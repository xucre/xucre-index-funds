      "description": "\"What is 1inch Network?\r\n1inch Network is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator to help users discover the best trade prices for tokens. Instead of swapping tokens from a single liquidity pool of a DEX, 1inch will aggregate across different pools and suggest the most efficient way to trade tokens.\r\n\r\nWhy use 1inch?\r\nIf you are a trader trading large amount of tokens, you may not be aware of all the availability liquidity across different DEXes in order to get the best price quote. Price quote offered by DEX fluctuates according to the liquidity pool at any given time. Also, when you are trading large size, every percentage of savings can be magnified with an optimal trading path. 1inch aims to solve all that in a single user friendly interface.\r\n\r\nWhat is Pathfinder?\r\nPathfinder is the discovery and routing algorithm developed by the 1inch team. It is the algorithm the powers the backend to finding the most efficient route to swap a token. For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for WBTC, Pathfinder will explore all DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, DODO, Sushiswap, and more. The result is a recommended route that optimizes fees and liquidity in order to give users the best rate. Users no longer need to check each individual services in order to find the best price.\r\n\r\nWho are the creators of 1inch?\r\n1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov. The idea for 1inch was developed at a hackathon in just over 60 hours at New York City. Fast forward today, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi product.\"",

New intellectual property is being created from the bottom-up, without the involvement of major corporate studios or large budgets. \r\nCreators and communities will soon demand to do more with their NFTs, and the Alethea AI team sees the Noahâs Ark Intelligent Metaverse as the connective tissue for the numerous  NFT projects and owners to bond and create rich, free-flowing, enjoyable interactive experiences on a crypto-native stack.\r\n\r\nAs the population of iNFTs within the Noahâs Ark increases, so too will the possibilities of interactions and collaborations with and between these iNFTs - enabling the emergence of an \"\"Intelligent Hive Mind\"\", powering the Ark's AI Engine. This intelligence will enable us to not only explore what it means to be human and what constitutes a personality, but also to discover how an Intelligent Metaverse powered by such an Intelligence can help shape our stories, culture, and intelligence as we realize the true meaning behind being Homo Narrans.",

        "description": "Alethea AI is building a decentralized protocol to create an Intelligent Metaverse inhabited by interactive and intelligent NFTs (iNFTs). As originators of the iNFT standard, Alethea AI is on the cutting edge of embedding AI animation, interaction and generative AI capabilities into NFTs. Developers can use the iNFT protocol to Create, Train and Earn from their iNFTs in the worldâs first Intelligent Metaverse known as Noahâs Ark.\r\nNoah's Ark has a bold aim: To preserve and evolve the culture, stories and collective intelligence of the human species.\r\n\r\nThe NFT ecosystem is witnessing a Cambrian explosion in innovation and creativity, with avatar-centric communities launching at a scale and speed we never thought possible. New intellectual property is being created from the bottom-up, without the involvement of major corporate studios or large budgets. \r\nCreators and communities will soon demand to do more with their NFTs, and the Alethea AI team sees the Noahâs Ark Intelligent Metaverse as the connective tissue for the numerous  NFT projects and owners to bond and create rich, free-flowing, enjoyable interactive experiences on a crypto-native stack.\r\n\r\nAs the population of iNFTs within the Noahâs Ark increases, so too will the possibilities of interactions and collaborations with and between these iNFTs - enabling the emergence of an \"\"Intelligent Hive Mind\"\", powering the Ark's AI Engine. This intelligence will enable us to not only explore what it means to be human and what constitutes a personality, but also to discover how an Intelligent Metaverse powered by such an Intelligence can help shape our stories, culture, and intelligence as we realize the true meaning behind being Homo Narrans.",

This is lowest in comparison across other defi projects like Sushi\r\n- Best part 50% of the dev funds are used for buying bns on a periodic basis\r\n- Contract is super clean as there is no mint function there except for the block rewards which are happening every block. So there is no risk associated with it. No time lock needed as only BNSChef can mint rewards and those rewards are specific to block\"",

This is lowest in comparison across other defi projects like Sushi\r\n- Best part 50% of the dev funds are used for buying bns on a periodic basis\r\n- Contract is super clean as there is no mint function there except for the block rewards which are happening every block. So there is no risk associated with it. No time lock needed as only BNSChef can mint rewards and those rewards are specific to block\"",

      "description": "Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset.Â \r\n\r\nFor example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.\r\n\r\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield.Â ",

        "description": "Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset.Â \r\n\r\nFor example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.\r\n\r\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield.Â ",

      "description": "Film.io is a decentralized filmmaking ecosystem, placing Hollywood decision-making into the hands of creators and fans. Film.io leverages blockchain technology and fan collaboration to provide filmmakers with an end-to-end solution for creating, funding and distributing their projects.\r\n\r\nFilm.io liberates film and TV creators and replaces centralized power with collaboration and inclusivity. Film.ioâs platform allows creators to submit projects as proposals, build audiences and receive market validation, expanding access to funding and licensing.

Project team is diligently working on creating a platform that will allow each player to realize their ideas and become the creator of their own adventures. The application is developed by professionals with experience working in top gaming studios: Niantic (Pokemon Go), Wargaming (World of Tanks), Kama Games, Game Insight, and others.\r\n\r\nThe virtual map of MetaTrace is a replica of the real world, reflecting our entire globe. Every step you take in the real world impacts the events occurring within the game. Your physical activity is reflected in the game space, and your avatar accurately replicates your movements. Explore the space and find rewards in Boxes. Each box contains ACE tokens, various NFTs for participating in mini-games. \r\n\r\n## What is MetaTrace's mission? \r\n\r\nProject's team primary mission is to inspire and motivate millions of people to have more contact with the real world and engage in physical activity every day. MetaTrace believes that they can introduce players to the world around them in a new way, help them broaden their horizons, meet people, and explore new locations. Collect digital artifacts within your city and interact with other players, forge friendships, and exchange resources in MetaTrace.\r\n\r\nMetaTrace is not inventing new \"utopian\" metaverses and virtual worlds; instead, project team enhances the real world with interactive elements using Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. This allows players to feel each challenge more intensely, meet with friends more often, and actively develop beyond the game.\r\n\r\nMetaTrace also set an ambitious goal for themselves:\r\nto introduce tens of millions of users to the world of Web3 technologies. \r\n\r\n## What are principles of MetaTrace? \r\n\r\n- Engaging and understandable gameplay is the primary focus of the project team.\r\n- Qualitative Free-to-play, freedom for players to choose their own game format, and the possibility to use NFTs for advanced users.\r\n- The stability of the game economy always takes precedence over scaling and profitability.\r\n- Transparency and attention to communication with players. It is important for us to be open with our community and improve the product based on user feedback. All information about the project, as well as the team, is publicly available.\r\n- Forming prize pools for players through a clear business model.\r\n- Simplicity and accessibility of Web3 solutions in the game, convenience for beginners.\r\n- The security of each user's personal data.\r\n- Active blocking of farming and combat against it in the game.\r\n\r\n## What are advantages of MetaTrace? \r\n\r\n</b>Decentralization</b>\r\n\r\nWe offer you a complete control over your gaming assets. Thanks to NFT technology, every item, character, or artifact you own in MetaTrace becomes unique and irreplaceable. You can be confident that no one can counterfeit, alter, or steal your assets. This gives you complete freedom to own, trade, and collect NFTs.\r\n\r\n<b>Communication</b>\r\n\r\nA unique experience of interacting with other players. You will be able to communicate, unite, compete, and collaborate with players from all over the world.

Your talent, skill, luck, experience, and game knowledge become the foundation for receiving rewards. You can sell your unique gaming assets or offer services to other players.

Virtual landowners become active participants in the Next Earth economy, where they will have the ability to run businesses, participate in the DAO governing the Metaverse and receive income for the activity that takes place on the platform. \r\n\r\nVR and user created content will be essential in the democratised future, but Next Earth builds its foundations on creating a self-sustaining Metaverse economy first. So it will have massive opportunities in the future to be able to deliver state of the art technical solutions, by the time the Metaverse is ready to truly welcome and entertain users 24/7. \r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of NXTT the company will publish a series of proposals called NEIPs that will shape the future of the platform and serve as a roadmap. The community will be able to vote in the best and most promising NEIPs, getting a significant say in which direction Next Earth is going.\r\n\r\nHowever, building a profitable Metaverse is just the beginning. The endgame of Next Earth is a fully DAO controlled state of the art self-sustaining platform, that will head into becoming a non profit organization by time, with allocating all of its income outside of the platform operations to environmental charity.",

        "description": "Next Earth leverages the surface of the Earth as a starting point for the project, having sold over 400,000 virtual land NFTs since August 2021. Virtual landowners become active participants in the Next Earth economy, where they will have the ability to run businesses, participate in the DAO governing the Metaverse and receive income for the activity that takes place on the platform. \r\n\r\nVR and user created content will be essential in the democratised future, but Next Earth builds its foundations on creating a self-sustaining Metaverse economy first. So it will have massive opportunities in the future to be able to deliver state of the art technical solutions, by the time the Metaverse is ready to truly welcome and entertain users 24/7. \r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of NXTT the company will publish a series of proposals called NEIPs that will shape the future of the platform and serve as a roadmap. The community will be able to vote in the best and most promising NEIPs, getting a significant say in which direction Next Earth is going.\r\n\r\nHowever, building a profitable Metaverse is just the beginning. The endgame of Next Earth is a fully DAO controlled state of the art self-sustaining platform, that will head into becoming a non profit organization by time, with allocating all of its income outside of the platform operations to environmental charity.",

      "description": "The native cryptographically-secured fungible protocol token of Pine (ticker symbol $PINE) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Pine, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.\r\n\r\n$PINE functions as the native governance token, access token, and economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on Pine, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. $PINE is an integral and indispensable part of Pine, because without $PINE, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on Pine. Given that additional $PINE will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on Pine and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of Pine and/or holders of $PINE which did not actively participate will not receive any $PINE incentives.\r\n\r\n$PINE Holders will have control over the PineDAO which governs both the Pine protocol and the Pine Platform and manages their future development. $PINE would allow holders to propose and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features and/or parameters of Pine, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Pine; it does not entitle $PINE holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, nor does $PINE constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). For example, users may propose usage of the PineDAO Treasury (which holds protocol funds) for platform/protocol maintenance, enhancements, grants, strategic partnership budgets, governance initiatives and other incentive programs. After governance launch there will be no individual or corporate entity or other active promoter, sponsor, or group or affiliated party that maintains sole control over Pine.\r\n\r\nPine itself is simply a blockchain protocol that, by design, does not offer any resources for utilisation As such, in order for the protocol to perform its core function as a NFT liquidity protocol, users would need to be incentivised to deposit assets in the borrowing liquidity pools to provide liquidity for loans. As their reward, these liquidity providers which help to promote adoption of Pine by staking or including assets to liquidity pools in exchange for LP tokens would be rewarded with $PINE, according to each user's relative contribution after various adjustment and correction parameters. By distributing $PINE in this manner, it ensures that the governance token will be distributed primarily to key network contributors and allow them to have a say in protocol parameters.\r\n\r\nLikewise, users which deposit their NFTs and take out loans may also participate in the user incentive programs.\r\n\r\n$PINE functions as a loyalty membership point, so users will be classified into different loyalty tiers based on the amount of $PINE held, user activity, and/or volume of transactions. $PINE Holders will get exclusive access to tier-based special perks and access rights, some examples are exclusive first rights to buy certain liquidated NFT assets, interest rate or service fee discount for borrowing, or achieving seniority in the platform which will allow the lender to charge more favourable interest rates on loans.",

        "description": "The native cryptographically-secured fungible protocol token of Pine (ticker symbol $PINE) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Pine, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.\r\n\r\n$PINE functions as the native governance token, access token, and economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on Pine, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. $PINE is an integral and indispensable part of Pine, because without $PINE, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on Pine. Given that additional $PINE will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on Pine and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of Pine and/or holders of $PINE which did not actively participate will not receive any $PINE incentives.\r\n\r\n$PINE Holders will have control over the PineDAO which governs both the Pine protocol and the Pine Platform and manages their future development. $PINE would allow holders to propose and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features and/or parameters of Pine, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Pine; it does not entitle $PINE holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, nor does $PINE constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). For example, users may propose usage of the PineDAO Treasury (which holds protocol funds) for platform/protocol maintenance, enhancements, grants, strategic partnership budgets, governance initiatives and other incentive programs. After governance launch there will be no individual or corporate entity or other active promoter, sponsor, or group or affiliated party that maintains sole control over Pine.\r\n\r\nPine itself is simply a blockchain protocol that, by design, does not offer any resources for utilisation As such, in order for the protocol to perform its core function as a NFT liquidity protocol, users would need to be incentivised to deposit assets in the borrowing liquidity pools to provide liquidity for loans. As their reward, these liquidity providers which help to promote adoption of Pine by staking or including assets to liquidity pools in exchange for LP tokens would be rewarded with $PINE, according to each user's relative contribution after various adjustment and correction parameters. By distributing $PINE in this manner, it ensures that the governance token will be distributed primarily to key network contributors and allow them to have a say in protocol parameters.\r\n\r\nLikewise, users which deposit their NFTs and take out loans may also participate in the user incentive programs.\r\n\r\n$PINE functions as a loyalty membership point, so users will be classified into different loyalty tiers based on the amount of $PINE held, user activity, and/or volume of transactions. $PINE Holders will get exclusive access to tier-based special perks and access rights, some examples are exclusive first rights to buy certain liquidated NFT assets, interest rate or service fee discount for borrowing, or achieving seniority in the platform which will allow the lender to charge more favourable interest rates on loans.",

Existing solutions bringing Bitcoin to Ethereum require you to send your Bitcoin to an intermediary, who then issues you an Ethereum token representing your original asset. \r\n\r\nThis centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is prone to censorship, sacrificing Bitcoin's promise of secure, permissionless decentralization.\r\n\r\nHow does tBTC solve this issue?\r\nInstead of centralized intermediaries, tBTC uses a randomly selected group of operators running nodes on the Threshold Network to secure deposited Bitcoin through threshold cryptography. \r\n\r\nThat means tBTC requires a threshold majority agreement before operators perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection of operators weekly, tBTC protects against any individual or group of operators colluding to fraudulently seize the underlying deposits. \r\n\r\nBy relying on an honest-majority-assumption, we can calculate the likelihood any wallet comprised of a quorum of dishonest operators. An insurance backstop (the coverage pools), serves as an emergency fallback in the event a wallet is compromised.\r\n\r\nWhat is Threshold Network?\r\nThreshold.network stems from the merger of NuCypher and Keep networks into a single decentralized network â it delivers a suite of threshold cryptography services for web3 applications through a decentralized network of staking nodes.

Instead of swapping tokens from a single liquidity pool of a DEX, 1inch will aggregate across different pools and suggest the most efficient way to trade tokens.\r\n\r\nWhy use 1inch?\r\nIf you are a trader trading large amount of tokens, you may not be aware of all the availability liquidity across different DEXes in order to get the best price quote. Price quote offered by DEX fluctuates according to the liquidity pool at any given time. Also, when you are trading large size, every percentage of savings can be magnified with an optimal trading path. 1inch aims to solve all that in a single user friendly interface.\r\n\r\nWhat is Pathfinder?\r\nPathfinder is the discovery and routing algorithm developed by the 1inch team. It is the algorithm the powers the backend to finding the most efficient route to swap a token. For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for WBTC, Pathfinder will explore all DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, DODO, Sushiswap, and more. The result is a recommended route that optimizes fees and liquidity in order to give users the best rate. Users no longer need to check each individual services in order to find the best price.\r\n\r\nWho are the creators of 1inch?\r\n1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov. The idea for 1inch was developed at a hackathon in just over 60 hours at New York City. Fast forward today, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi product.\"",

Film.ioâs platform allows creators to submit projects as proposals, build audiences and receive market validation, expanding access to funding and licensing. It empowers fans to vote on film and TV projects by staking Film.ioâs native FAN Token to projects they support and allows film investors, studios and streamers to scout market-validated projects with pre-developed audiences and analytics. FAN Tokens are the governance and platform token, used to join and participate in the DAO as well as other platform activities. \r\n\r\nFilm.io is owned by the Global Creativity Foundation and was originally created by Ingredient X, a film and software development studio specializing in blockchain, DeFi and NFT technologies. Ingredient X leverages the power of the fully decentralized Film.io ecosystem to produce original Film, TV and NFT projects, including the critically acclaimed Star Wars autobiographical coming-of-age comedy, â5-25-77â, the film âCryptoâ starring Alexis Bledel, Luke Hemsworth, and Kurt Russell, Blood Window Award NFT digital collectibles of 15 original pieces created by famed artist Flavio Greco Paglia â recognized worldwide for his mind-bending illustrations within the science fiction and horror genre, and âLandmarks Live In Concertâ, a hybrid travelog and music documentary series hosted by Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, featuring renowned musicians such as K.D. Lang, Alicia Keys and Foo Fighters.",

      "description": "What Is KlimaDAO?\r\nKlimaDAO is building the infrastructure for a transparent, neutral, and public Digital Carbon Market to accelerate climate finance on a global scale.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, KlimaDAO traded over $4 billion worth of carbon credit trade while growing treasury assets to over $100 million.\r\n\r\nWho uses KlimaDAO?\r\nAs the base layer infrastructure for the Digital Carbon Market, KlimaDAO powers platforms such as Carbonmark, the universal carbon market, and works with organizations such as Polygon, Circle, and the Liechtenstein Bankers Association to help organizations such as airlines, auto companies, banks, Web3 projects, and individuals such as Mark Cuban to meet their sustainability goals.\r\n\r\nA brief history of KlimaDAO\r\nKlimaDAO was founded in 2021 by a group of individuals from three competing organizations who had been working to solve market failures in the traditional Voluntary Carbon Market. These founding Core contributors aimed to unite their diverse experience â in carbon markets, technology, and business strategy and execution â as part of a single mission, in order to solve bottlenecks in scaling climate finance globally.\r\n\r\nKlimaDAO has since grown to assemble the talents of over 50 contributors, and over 100,000 KLIMA token holders.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 KlimaDAO launched its carbon retirement aggregator, enabling individuals and organizations to permissionlessly offset their carbon footprints. One of its landmark early users was the Polygon Network, which used KlimaDAOâs infrastructure to retire over 100,000 digital carbon credits to go carbon neutral. Brands such as Instagram, Nike, and Bentley chose to build with Polygon due to its leadership in sustainability. \r\n\r\nIn March 2023 Carbonmark launched as the go-to platform for acquiring, trading, and retiring digital carbon. Carbonmark offers a seamless âWeb 2.5â user experience, enabling institutional access to tens of millions of carbon credits, and to KlimaDAOâs digital carbon infrastructure, without additional fees.",

        "description": "What Is KlimaDAO?\r\nKlimaDAO is building the infrastructure for a transparent, neutral, and public Digital Carbon Market to accelerate climate finance on a global scale.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, KlimaDAO traded over $4 billion worth of carbon credit trade while growing treasury assets to over $100 million.\r\n\r\nWho uses KlimaDAO?\r\nAs the base layer infrastructure for the Digital Carbon Market, KlimaDAO powers platforms such as Carbonmark, the universal carbon market, and works with organizations such as Polygon, Circle, and the Liechtenstein Bankers Association to help organizations such as airlines, auto companies, banks, Web3 projects, and individuals such as Mark Cuban to meet their sustainability goals.\r\n\r\nA brief history of KlimaDAO\r\nKlimaDAO was founded in 2021 by a group of individuals from three competing organizations who had been working to solve market failures in the traditional Voluntary Carbon Market. These founding Core contributors aimed to unite their diverse experience â in carbon markets, technology, and business strategy and execution â as part of a single mission, in order to solve bottlenecks in scaling climate finance globally.\r\n\r\nKlimaDAO has since grown to assemble the talents of over 50 contributors, and over 100,000 KLIMA token holders.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 KlimaDAO launched its carbon retirement aggregator, enabling individuals and organizations to permissionlessly offset their carbon footprints. One of its landmark early users was the Polygon Network, which used KlimaDAOâs infrastructure to retire over 100,000 digital carbon credits to go carbon neutral. Brands such as Instagram, Nike, and Bentley chose to build with Polygon due to its leadership in sustainability. \r\n\r\nIn March 2023 Carbonmark launched as the go-to platform for acquiring, trading, and retiring digital carbon. Carbonmark offers a seamless âWeb 2.5â user experience, enabling institutional access to tens of millions of carbon credits, and to KlimaDAOâs digital carbon infrastructure, without additional fees.",

      "description": "MKR is a cryptocurrency depicted as a smart contract platform and works alongside the Dai coin and aims to act as a hedge currency that provides traders with a stable alternative to the majority of coins currently available on the market. Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Makerâs MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward â itâs a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. Itâs instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Makerâs continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. Itâs a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins donât negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.",

By rotating the selection of operators weekly, tBTC protects against any individual or group of operators colluding to fraudulently seize the underlying deposits. \r\n\r\nBy relying on an honest-majority-assumption, we can calculate the likelihood any wallet comprised of a quorum of dishonest operators.

      "description": "Wrapped Kaspa (wKAS) is a blockchain-based initiative aimed at increasing interoperability between the Kaspa network and the Ethereum network. It's a tokenized version of the Kaspa (KAS) digital currency, encapsulated within an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of creating Wrapped Kaspa is to allow Kaspa to be more easily integrated and interacted with in the world of Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The token operates on a 1:1 ratio with Kaspa, meaning each Wrapped Kaspa token is equivalent to one Kaspa. This approach enables the transfer of value between the two separate blockchains, bridging the gap and allowing users to utilize the benefits of both networks.\r\n\r\nThe key benefit of wKAS is the ability for users to participate in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem using their Kaspa holdings, unlocking access to a wide range of services including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, and more.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the balance of wKAS and KAS, Chainge, a trusted custodian, holds the necessary amount of KAS in reserve. This ensures the value of the wrapped token and allows for the reverse process (unwrapping), where users can exchange their wKAS back into KAS at any time.",

        "description": "Wrapped Kaspa (wKAS) is a blockchain-based initiative aimed at increasing interoperability between the Kaspa network and the Ethereum network. It's a tokenized version of the Kaspa (KAS) digital currency, encapsulated within an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of creating Wrapped Kaspa is to allow Kaspa to be more easily integrated and interacted with in the world of Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The token operates on a 1:1 ratio with Kaspa, meaning each Wrapped Kaspa token is equivalent to one Kaspa. This approach enables the transfer of value between the two separate blockchains, bridging the gap and allowing users to utilize the benefits of both networks.\r\n\r\nThe key benefit of wKAS is the ability for users to participate in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem using their Kaspa holdings, unlocking access to a wide range of services including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, and more.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the balance of wKAS and KAS, Chainge, a trusted custodian, holds the necessary amount of KAS in reserve. This ensures the value of the wrapped token and allows for the reverse process (unwrapping), where users can exchange their wKAS back into KAS at any time.",
