      "description": "\"What is 1inch Network?\r\n1inch Network is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator to help users discover the best trade prices for tokens. Instead of swapping tokens from a single liquidity pool of a DEX, 1inch will aggregate across different pools and suggest the most efficient way to trade tokens.\r\n\r\nWhy use 1inch?\r\nIf you are a trader trading large amount of tokens, you may not be aware of all the availability liquidity across different DEXes in order to get the best price quote. Price quote offered by DEX fluctuates according to the liquidity pool at any given time. Also, when you are trading large size, every percentage of savings can be magnified with an optimal trading path. 1inch aims to solve all that in a single user friendly interface.\r\n\r\nWhat is Pathfinder?\r\nPathfinder is the discovery and routing algorithm developed by the 1inch team. It is the algorithm the powers the backend to finding the most efficient route to swap a token. For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for WBTC, Pathfinder will explore all DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, DODO, Sushiswap, and more. The result is a recommended route that optimizes fees and liquidity in order to give users the best rate. Users no longer need to check each individual services in order to find the best price.\r\n\r\nWho are the creators of 1inch?\r\n1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov. The idea for 1inch was developed at a hackathon in just over 60 hours at New York City. Fast forward today, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi product.\"",

One of the biggest problems today is the connection between being multi-chain and the bridging process. \r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nWe continue to hear about exploits on various bridges, which is not only a risk but also one of the weakest links when we look at blockchain infrastructure. We have all heard about the wormhole and ronin bridge hacks, accounting for close to $900MM in lost funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\nLaunch in late May\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nThe native token of Altitude DeFi, ALTD, is a governance token. Liquidity providers are able to stake into single-sided asset pools with zero impermanent loss while collecting fees from inbound transfers regardless of the deriving chain. Users no longer need to swap out undesirable assets on the destination chain or have a scenario where a transfer fails due to varying irregularities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Arable Protocol is a synthetic yield farming protocol that is dedicated to helping yield farmers access multiple blockchains (such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos or Polygon) assets and yields on a single chain. The biggest challenge in earning high yields in the DeFi space is the need to bridge assets across chains, requiring constant bridge fees that limit returns. Arable is changing that by providing the first single chain platform that enables multi-chain farming. The platform is supported by incentivized collateral providers (aka. stakers or minters) for synthetic assets. Users receive the same rewards as they would on native chains.\r\n\r\nMany different blockchains are now supporting liquidity mining pools and providing incentive mechanisms, but the transfer of the assets between different chains takes time and fees and requires chain and bridge specific knowledge. This is leading users to feel confusing which chain to stick on for yield farming. Synthetic assets are essentially tokenized derivatives to support people to buy or sell specific assets on native assets’ price.\r\n\r\nARABLE’s goal is to provide an environment where yield farmers can access all the crypto farming assets on a single chain, where the users receive the same rewards as they would on native-chains. The environment is supported by incentivized collateral providers (aka. stakers or minters) for synthetic assets.",

Unlike many other tokens in the DeFi ecosystem, USV is backed by the Atlas treasury, giving it an intrinsic, rising value also known as \"\"the book value\"\". Atlas USV's Treasury is made of 5 components: Stables, USV Liquidity, Passive Growth Tokens, Partner Tokens, and Other Atlas Layers.\r\n\r\n(1) Stables such as DAI and Frax are required to mint USV.\r\n(2) USV Liquidity Pool Tokens are offered through barter contracts and owned by the treasury.\r\n(3) The Passive Growth portfolio of tokens is managed by an engine that optimizes the portfolio's formula using a modified version of Markowitz's Optimal Portfolio Theory (Harry Markowitz, \"\"Portfolio Selection\"\" The Journal of Finance, 1952). This feature is coming soon.\r\n(4) Atlas USV is built to be the default backbone currency for DeFi. As such, Atlas expects major partnerships with other protocols that will benefit the treasury.\r\n(5) The Atlas Project will continue to release more layers with additional, distinct utilities and tokens that build on Atlas USV. The treasury will accumulate these tokens and capture value from these additional layers.",

      "description": "Autonolas, also known as Olas, is a unified network of off-chain services such as automation, oracles, and co-owned AI. It offers a composable stack for building these services and a protocol for incentivizing their creation. Autonolas uniquely enables the operation of these services in a co-owned and decentralized manner.\r\n\r\nAutonolas services are ideal for combining crypto and AI, executing complex logic in a decentralized manner, and interacting with on- and off-chain data autonomously and continuously. A novel use case of this cutting-edge autonomous agent technology is Governatooorr, an AI-enabled governance delegate for DAOs.\r\n\r\nAutonolas DAO was established in the summer of 2022, and the public token launch took place via a liquidity bootstrapping pool in July 2023.\r\n\r\nAutonolas is on a healthy growth trajectory and is regularly adding support for additional chains. The project's goal is to be deployed on every major blockchain, powering their core off-chain services and realizing the vision of a unified network of off-chain services.\r\n\r\nThe OLAS token provides access to the network's core functions. Users can stake OLAS to operate off-chain services and lock OLAS in veOLAS to gain governance rights, thereby contributing to the shaping of the network. Furthermore, OLAS powers a unique system of developer incentives aimed at expanding the number of services in the Olas ecosystem. Governance members can boost ETH donations to desirable services, made up of autonomous agents and their software components and referred to as  'useful code', with OLAS from the protocol. Existing token holders can bond LP shares involving OLAS into the protocol to increase protocol-owned liquidity, known as 'useful capital'. For more information, visit the DAO’s website at https://olas.network.",

The changes in the relative prices are predictable, and so the opportunity to profit doesn't depend on speculation.

You can think of it as Stripe for Web3. Developers interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.\r\n\r\nAxelar is a blockchain that connects blockchains. To do this securely, Axelar network uses proof-of-stake consensus. Network validators produce new blocks, participate in multiparty signing and vote on external chain states. Tokenholders stake the AXL token, delegating tokens to a validator’s staking pool and receiving rewards, minus the validator’s commission.\r\n\r\nThe AXL token is used for governance and to pay network transaction fees to validators and tokenholders. However, users of the Axelar network do not need to hold the token. Conversions into AXL tokens and destination-chain tokens are handled on the back end, so that users need only pay gas once, in the source-chain token.\r\n\r\nAxelar network rewards are “inflationary” — they increase the total supply of AXL — but there is potential for supply to become deflationary based on the transaction fee mechanic described above.

Mint via Satellite, a cross-chain bridge built by Axelar How is axlETH secured? Like all Axelar-wrapped assets, axlETH's security depends on a dynamic validator set (numbering 75 at this writing), running delegated proof-of-stake. In other words, Axelar secures cross-chain communication using the same approach as many of the chains it connects. Units of axlETH are minted when a user deposits USDC into a Gateway contract on the Ethereum chain. Axelar's decentralized validator set secures these Gateways via key shares in a multiparty cryptography scheme. Here's a brief explanation of Gateways and how they are secured, from the \"Learn More\" section of the Axelar documentation: Once a cross-chain message is initiated by a dApp user, its first stop is to interact with an Axelar Gateway. On each chain connected to Axelar network, a Gateway is deployed. On EVM chains, it is a smart contract address. On Cosmos and other non-EVM chains, it is an application with logic and the ability to communicate with Axelar network. This Gateway is used to receive messages from a connected dApp and send them into the Axelar network for routing to any connected chain. The Gateway is controlled by a key, which is held jointly by all Axelar validators. This is accomplished through a multiparty cryptography scheme, where the key is divided into many pieces, called key shares. Each validator holds many key shares, and the amount of shares is dictated by the amount AXL tokens staked with the validator.",

Basic Attention Token held an initial coin offering on May 31, 2017 for its eponymous ERC-20 utility token, raising approximately $35M USD at the time in less than 30 seconds. The Basic Attention Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque. \r\n\r\nBasic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data. Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates into rewards for publishers.\r\n\r\nA user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements, is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.\r\n\r\nCreated back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla. Other noteworthy team members include Brian Bondy, lead developer and co-founder of Brave and Scott Locklin, senior engineer, and co-founder of Kerf Software.\"\r\n\r\nBasic Attention Token is created by the team that built the <a href=\"https://brave.com/coi600\">Brave browser</a>, an open-source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers.

It enables the users of bitmarkets.com to perform cryptocurrency exchanges with low fees, participate in new token projects and initial exchange offerings in the platform, and indicate their preference regarding ecological and social impact investments of the company. In order to make its functionality align with the BITmarkets’ business model and social agenda, its smart contract induces a small transfer fee which is distributed between two dedicated BITmarkets-controlled wallets, the profits wallet and an ESG fund wallet. The accumulated funds on the ESG fund wallet will be distributed to an organization from a list of selected social impact companies and NGOs. The BTMT community will periodically vote to determine the organization. There will be three lists, a list of considered tokens where BTMT holders will be able to vote for their favorite projects, a list of upcoming token projects, and a list of active token projects. The Token Project dashboard feature will allow small developer teams with small or no backing to raise capital from platform users who support the team’s vision and see their product’s potential. The teams wanting to be listed on the dashboard will need to file an application which will be reviewed by a dedicated BITmarkets team. The internal team will rate the project based on its social impact, industry significance, the team’s trustworthiness, legal status, and various other factors. Once approved, the team will allocate a percentage of BTMT Tokens to the Token Project. Participants will have to exchange BTMT for the project’s tokens at the specified exchange rate. Once each project sale is completed, the funds will be unlocked with a linear vesting schedule. Participants will then receive their purchased tokens while the team will receive BTMT. It is important to state that BITmarkets will not be acting as an investment manager or advisor when deploying funds into ESG projects. The purpose of the ESG projects is to promote good causes (based on the voting of the BITmarkets community) and not to make a profit on investment.",

      "description": "\"Eternal Crypt - Wizardry BC -\"\" is a blockchain game that utilises the Wizardry IP, also known as the origin of RPGs, and uses the utility token Blood Crystal (BC token).\r\nIn this game, players explore a dungeon called \"\"\"\"Dadoel's Hole\"\"\"\" with up to 36 adventurers and aim for the abyss by devising party compositions and strategically training adventurers to defeat difficult enemies. By exploring, you can obtain BC tokens and treasure chests, and if you successfully open the treasure chests, you can obtain various items. This is a strategic game where you can enjoy both the easy-to-play game system that allows you to play in your spare time and the 'intelligence' that is unique to 'Wizardry'.\r\n\r\nIn this game, players form a party of adventurers and conquer dungeons. Adventurers come in five rarities: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Genesis. Rarities above Rare can be taken out of the game or bought and sold in the marketplace as NFT. To earn BC tokens, you basically need to own this adventurer NFT, form a party and play the game.\r\n\r\nThere are four races of adventurers - humans, elves, dwarves and felpers - and eight professions - warrior, monk, wizard, thief, priest, samurai, monarch and ninja - with different abilities based on race and profession, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. As a guild master, the player must form a party according to the situation and use their own strategy to progress through the dungeon, with the adventure rewards (BC tokens) varying according to how deep into the dungeon they can reach in one exploration.\r\nThere are endless possibilities for party composition, and the adventure style varies depending on how you develop your skills and legacy items.\r\n\r\nClick here to continue.\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/16oP0OCO6Tcypixuvi3gMTZg0mqtpmV8JDLHkI6SJeEY/edit?usp=sharing",

Members will be able to borrow USD against their crypto holdings in their wallet which will be used as collateral. Our goal is to allow anyone who’s in need of cash to easily borrow from the Celsius platform without having to sell their crypto holdings. In the future, through the Celsius Network, cryptocurrencies deposited by members into their Celsius Wallet will be available on the network for immediate borrowing and shorting.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "The Cherry Project is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization developing a layer one blockchain network optimized for data operations. Cherry serves as a purpose-specific infrastructure for decentralized applications handling data. Built on Substrate, it implements state-of-the-art cryptographic standards to provide for second layer scalability (zkSNARKs) and features a node-level IPFS integration that allows the Cherry Virtual Machine to natively interface with an indexed queryable data storage and referencing facility. This novel native node to IPFS communication mechanism allows smart contracts to interact with an updated state of the data in runtime. These advanced features come prebuilt in our core and are accessible on other blockchains through Cherry’s interoperability channels. Decentralized applications built on Cherry or many of the most renowned decentralized networks can now leverage Cherry’s features to augment their dApps. Most of the complexities of building-integrated web3 applications handling data are, thus, abstracted away to the core, allowing smart contract developers to rely on a rich base layer toolkit, and ultimately focus on best serving their customers.",

      "description": "Crypto Royale is a browser-based, free-to-play, play-to-earn game in which players compete for fame, glory and a little profit. Last man standing wins crypto. No up-front investment. No downloads. No signups. Get into a game in 30 seconds and win! The game is purposefully designed to be simple to play yet difficult to master. \r\n\r\nEvery day 1000+ players congregate on the battlefield as they fight to see who can survive and claim the game’s HRC-20 token – ROY. Players enter a battlefield where they must be ‘the last person standing’. Represented by moons, a player’s ‘character’ can be one of three colours (Yellow, Pink, Blue). Colours are interchangeable by collecting boxes dropped onto the battlefield and must be used to ensure a player’s strength over an opponent in an effort to outsmart, outwit and out manoeuvre other players to become the victor. \r\n\r\nThe game allows for each player to adopt a style of their own, and often becomes an identifiable trait/signature of said player. Whatever a player and opponents’ strategy there is a continual external force adding pressure to the gameplay – a closing circle. Venturing outside into the darkness causes a deterioration in health, but the collectables outside can, and often do, provide the weapons needed to claim victory. Positioning and timing are critical components to a player’s skill set. ",

      "description": "Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. \r\n\r\nFor example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.\r\n\r\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ",

As products and partnerships are made where Dark Magic has functionality in its own and other ecosystems, the volume and transfers of Dark Magic increases. This increase also uplifts the amount of transaction fees that go towards yield farming rewards, future development, and burning where tokens are removed from supply forever. As more tokens are locked into the liquidity pool and tokens are burned, the price floor of Dark Magic increases over time, creating an exponential growth curve. As liquidity is locked, any paired tokens to Dark Magic beneath the price floor can be accessed via a call function and \"swept out\" to use for the benefit of the project such as creating additional yield farms and rewards for other products and actions.",

      "description": "Davos is a brand new protocol that provides an easy-to-use lending and staking experience to users with a dual token model system. Through a yield-earning over-collateralized debt position backed by accepted collateral and DeFi liquid staking rewards, users will be able to borrow a stable asset that can generate consistent yield. There are several passive earning opportunities within DeFi, but those income streams are subject to strong fluctuations, and many have high entry fees.\r\n\r\nLiquid staking is quickly becoming the most stable way to generate income (in percentage terms). Using the well-established MakerDAO model, Davos adds another layer of composability to generate additional passive income by using collateralized lending on top of staking rewards from its Stable Asset Davos.\r\n\r\nDavos Protocol allows users to effortlessly borrow DAVOS Stable Assets against their over-collateralized crypto assets while maintaining their liquidity. When users deposit crypto in smart contracts, they receive an equivalent liquid derivative token. This is a token that remains fungible and transferrable in addition to earning rewards regularly.\r\n\r\nDavos has been built by experienced DeFi experts and smart contract developers with the goal to position the world-class revolutionary DAVOS Stable Asset as the most widely used decentralized stable asset protocol, by leveraging Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards, Liquid Staking, and yield-bearing assets. By taking advantage of Liquid Staking and providing an APR of around 6-12%, Davos will provide users with a stable yearly APR of up to 9-24% for yield farming in the liquidity pool.\r\n\r\nThe Davos team aims to help promote blockchain technologies into mainstream adoption by incentivizing borrowers and stakers to become a part of a new decentralized economy of scale.",

It also serves as a governance & staking token offering its holders the ability to decide on the game’s future whilst empowering them through DeFi.\r\nEach dog has its own specific attributes that evolve in different stages and players can compete in real-time competitions and events. The better you raise your dog, the more you earn! As you train your dog from a puppy to your best friend, each action you choose earns you $DOGA. Furthermore, $DOGA is required to breed new DOGAMÍ, which can be kept or sold to new owners on secondary marketplaces.\r\nDOGAMÍ was created mid 2021 by 4 co-founders and boasts a team of 20 full-time employees - many of whom have extensive experience in game development. It was listed as one of 15 gaming startups to watch in Europe by Sifted. DOGAMÍ was early advised by The Sandbox Co-founder Sebastien Borget. The company successfully raised 6 million dollars through world-famous investors such as Ubisoft, Animoca Brands, XAnge Ventures.\r\nTheir first NFT drop of 8000 dog avatars sold out in just a few hours propelling them to #1 place in terms of volume traded on major Tezos NFT platform 'Objkt'.",

Dog Collar, simplistic in its code and born out of an apparent coding tutorial, is as basic a token as one can expect.\r\nAfter creation, Dog Collar was left cast aside and overshadowed for weeks by other projects on ShibSwap. As the second token to be launched on ShibaSwap, (with half the supply burned to the Shib token contract), community members decided to revitalize this underdog and prove gimmicks, fancy code, and “to the moon” marketing pushes are not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe fundamentals of Dog Collar are, and always have been, the community itself. The community infuses purpose, utility, and direction to Dog Collar. The community holds the intrinsic value, not the token. Tokens are simply an object to focus the power, talent, and tremendous ability of the community.\r\n\r\nTo that end, there will be no hidden roadmap, secret plans, or other opportunities for “insiders” to buy. All future developments, roadmaps, and opportunities will be planned in the open with input from all who wish to contribute. To our future -- together. #collarcrew",

Here, in Los Machines, the robots have been left to build their own dysfunctional society, where power is taken, not earned.\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing a unique robot NFT (there are 10101 Drunk Robots NFTs in total), players will have to fight for survival as they attempt to seize control of Los Machines. Engage in brutal PVP battles, venture out on expeditions to find metal and junk, join a gang of fellow drunks, and customize your robot with upgraded weapons, gear, and collectibles.\r\n\r\nOn top of all that action, players can also enjoy many free-to-play activities that don’t even require the purchase of a robot NFT, such as mini games that also award valuable prizes such as equipment for the robots. These prizes come in the form of NFTs, so you can use them or sell them on the secondary marketplace!",

For players that love the PVE experience, we have Adventure Mode, a series of missions culminating in the fight against the Skeleton Master. And for the players that really just want to fight other players, we have the Arena and Guild Wars.\r\n\r\nThe game features a deceptively simple presentation with eye-catching fantasy graphics that conceal deep strategic structure and tactical nuance underneath. As you progress through the game, you'll recruit new heroes to join you in the battle to protect the realms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses (plus weapons and accessories) that provide varying advantages and drawbacks against enemy teams.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the team wants to create an enjoyable game whose experience is enhanced by NFT collectibles and not the other way around.

      "description": "The FORT token is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThe use cases of the token are:\r\n\r\n1) Node Runner Staking. Node runners must deposit FORT Tokens to provide economic security for the work they are performing, since the staked FORT can be slashed if a node fails to execute their assigned work or performs their work maliciously. Once FORT is staked, it may only be withdrawn subject to a thawing period, which provides ample opportunity for verification and dispute resolution. Active node operators may earn rewards in FORT from the Network if they maintain the minimum stake and emit alerts and execute their assigned work correctly.\r\n\r\n2) Delegated staking: FORT holders have the possibility to delegate to scan node pools. This action improves the security of the network and enables delegators to participate in the rewards distribution. \r\n\r\n3) Minimum Bot Stake Requirement. The purpose is to protect the network from spam and malicious bots. Therefore there is a minimum stake required (100 FORT) for any detection bot to execute on the Forta network.\r\n\r\n4) Governance. While Forta is continuing to develop, including further evolution of community governance, it is crucial to maintain stability for Forta users that are relying on the Network’s real-time monitoring. For that reason, Forta intends to decentralize governance over the Network progressively, beginning with a period of Council governance, where FORT holders are able to participate and vote to express their opinion and shape the evolution of Forta via Snapshot Voting.",

      "description": "What is GeniuX (IUX)? The ecosystem is underpinned by GeniuX, a utility token based on the Polygon standard. It will be used to support the tokenization of real-world assets, with a wide range of sectors covered including real estate, transportation, sports, and arts.\r\n\r\nWho is the Founder of GeniuX (Genius Assets Marketplace)? Founded in 2018, we built the first and biggest, secure digital assets marketplace in the world. The project is owned by the company Genius Assets. It was founded by Claudiu Buda, and before that, in the last 13 years, his professional career has been focused on sales. Claudiu has built a large and immense community with more than 200.000 customers in 17 countries and sales of more than 75 million euros. Genius Assets was first launched in 2021 and had its Token Generation Event on June 18th, 2022, with the first real estate Fractional Ownership Project set to launch by the end of the year. It started from the main idea that each and every one of us can be a GENIUS itself and can make all our dreams come true. You just need to find your inside Genius and let it out for a higher purpose. Assets you can imagine from what they came from, but you don’t know the real reason. We wanted to combine the digital and real-world assets in a single marketplace, accessible for everyone, through GeniuX, which X marks the spot for a lifetime treasure.\r\n\r\nWhat makes GeniuX unique? Digital assets marketplace Genius Assets is a new project allowing decentralized investments in non-crypto assets. Through tokenization, Genius Assets will make it possible for ecosystem participants to hold digital shares in properties and other assets via fractional ownership and receive a corresponding percentage of the income those assets generate. The aim of the project is to make the token economy a viable option for long-term holders seeking regular revenue. While many of the investment opportunities available via the GeniuX token will be traditional, the possibility of participating in ICOs and NFT releases means the digital assets space will not be overlooked. A debit card, more real estate projects, an NFT marketplace, and further Defi integration will follow in 2023. The project founders ultimately hope to build the largest marketplace for high-value digital and physical assets on the blockchain.\r\n\r\nHow many GeniuX (IUX) coins are there in circulation? The IUX economic model has a total supply of 1,000,000,000.00 IUX. IUX’s native token was first made available for purchase through a private sale of 2% and a pre-sale of 5%. Of the remaining, for public sale there is available 24%, for Advisors and strategic partners 5%, incentives and airdrops 3%, and a total of 15% for the Burn Program. Allocated to Founders and Core Team there is 6%, for community rewards and development is 40%. Also, for sustainable Marketing 5%, for liquidity and exchange listing we allocated 5%, and for Staking and Growth 30%.\r\n\r\nHow is the GeniuX secured? There is a top3 IT & Blockchain company in East Europe that has developed the entire ecosystem, from scratch! A cyber security and stress testing on the platform are complete, using cutting edge technologies, creating a unique brand, with an inside blockchain developer who created the smart contract for the platform.\r\n\r\nThe Smart Contract has been audited by Hacken, a platform that enables everyone to become an ethical hacker to protect Web 3.0 space by encouraging cybersecurity!\r\n\r\nResults of SC audit: 9.90/10\r\n\r\nAudit report: https://hacken.io/audits/#geniusassets\r\n\r\nMedium article: https://medium.com/@geniusassets/genius-assets-x-hacken-d76bf6fc39fd",

GensoKishi already has a 3DMMORPG game with active users, with a fully-functioning 3D metaverse, that simultaneously connects users from around the world, be it smartphones, PCs,  or video game consoles. The development team behind the development has a brilliant track record, having developed online games and prominent MMORPG titles for 19 years. \r\n\r\nOur metaverse has a 13 year history. We have allowed users to come in and generate their own skins, characters, maps, and weapons for the past 13 years. Now, on this GameFi version, all these items will now be registered on the blockchain to be transferred, sold, and bought as NFTs. What's important, is that we've refined the UI/UX in which users come in and design their original content through the entirety of this game's existence. That is why the designability and usability of the NFT designing screen will be undoubtedly high.\r\n\r\nDevelopment will first focus on transferring our already existing MMORPG world onto the Blockchain to form the basis of the in-game economy. In this phase, the mechanism and framework for the production, sale, and distribution of in-game items, currencies, and characters will be completed.",

DeFi in its current state is inaccessible to most people due to the complexities and risks with the current set of tools and practices. Most people, even current crypto holders, have a hard time securing their private keys, on and off-ramping fiat, and interacting with smart contracts.\r\nThe Giddy token is the first step to solving this problem. With the EIP we’re developing, the Giddy token standard will allow smart contracts to communicate with compliant tokens in a way that encodes contract approval data into a meta-transaction, which removes the need for standalone, infinite contract approval, and also remediates the smart contract race condition described in SWC-114 (https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114)\r\nGiddy is also developing a non-custodial wallet that will provide multi-identity decentralized private security, direct fiat on and off-ramps, and one-tap smart contract staking. With our technological advances and powerful software, Giddy is going to provide the first user experience easy, safe, and fast enough for everyone to use.\r\n",

IRON Finance drew mainstream attention when it was revealed that American billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban had invested and lost $10 million when IRON Finance suffered a bank run. Cuban was one of the first liquidity providers of the protocol and was on the receiving end of public ridicule in June 2021 when the TITAN coin tanked from $60 to virtually 0 in a matter of hours. Mark Cuban meme's are a success in the TITAN is our DOGE community and his memes have been immortalised as NFTs in the TITAN Punkz NFT collection.\r\n\r\nWhy Investors Buy and Hold TITAN?\r\n\r\nThe TITANDAO community is creating the TITANVERSE, a digital reality centred around TITAN, which includes NFTs, DeFi, games, merchandise and much more. TITAN is the official currency of the TITANVERSE. All the TITAN Legions (communities) working to build the TITANVERSE can be found on their Discord Channel.\r\n\r\nTITAN is unique as its total supply has already been minted and it is capped at 35 trillion.

Future Conditional Transactions (FCT) is a new on-chain mini-scripting language at the transaction level for general-purpose feature development use cases. Simple FCTs can be created by utilizing the drop-and-drag UI. While more complex operations can be created with the SDK. it's a new way to interact with and build on the blockchain, providing developers with a new and innovative tool. Before FCTs, developers would only have two options when it came to the development and upgrading of DeFi protocols…namely Smart Contracts or Bots. Smart Contracts are costly, time-consuming, and expensive. They are also highly inflexible as, once deployed, they cannot be upgraded. Bots are flexible, but they are not secure. Developers lack a tool that is flexible, easy, and secure. FCTs are secure, flexible, upgradable, and thus scalable, adding to the developer's web3 toolbox. An FCT is an on-chain scripting language with built-in IFTTT logic that can be coded in any Web2 language. Starting with the visual builder, which utilizes a drop-and-drag UI, developers will be able to create products and services that are able to utilize currently deployed products such as Aave or Uniswap. Creating DeFi legos that can operate based on future conditions or execute immediately. Additionally, developers have access to the FCT SDK to develop any DeFi product that they can imagine without the need to know solidity or how to code a smart contract. Currently, FCTs operate on Ethereum. The roadmap envisages adding additional blockchains in the future.",

And there's no shortage of things to do in the game.\r\nPlayers can choose to engage in a variety of professions – or all of them – to master new abilities and create products to support their Kitsu collections. For example, they can become farmers to grow crops, who sell these to chefs who create delicious meals for Kitsu. They can learn alchemy to master potion-making, using the resulting consumables to boost their Kitsu's performance in battle.",

      "description": "What Is KlimaDAO?\r\nKlimaDAO is building the infrastructure for a transparent, neutral, and public Digital Carbon Market to accelerate climate finance on a global scale.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, KlimaDAO traded over $4 billion worth of carbon credit trade while growing treasury assets to over $100 million.\r\n\r\nWho uses KlimaDAO?\r\nAs the base layer infrastructure for the Digital Carbon Market, KlimaDAO powers platforms such as Carbonmark, the universal carbon market, and works with organizations such as Polygon, Circle, and the Liechtenstein Bankers Association to help organizations such as airlines, auto companies, banks, Web3 projects, and individuals such as Mark Cuban to meet their sustainability goals.\r\n\r\nA brief history of KlimaDAO\r\nKlimaDAO was founded in 2021 by a group of individuals from three competing organizations who had been working to solve market failures in the traditional Voluntary Carbon Market. These founding Core contributors aimed to unite their diverse experience – in carbon markets, technology, and business strategy and execution – as part of a single mission, in order to solve bottlenecks in scaling climate finance globally.\r\n\r\nKlimaDAO has since grown to assemble the talents of over 50 contributors, and over 100,000 KLIMA token holders.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 KlimaDAO launched its carbon retirement aggregator, enabling individuals and organizations to permissionlessly offset their carbon footprints. One of its landmark early users was the Polygon Network, which used KlimaDAO’s infrastructure to retire over 100,000 digital carbon credits to go carbon neutral. Brands such as Instagram, Nike, and Bentley chose to build with Polygon due to its leadership in sustainability. \r\n\r\nIn March 2023 Carbonmark launched as the go-to platform for acquiring, trading, and retiring digital carbon. Carbonmark offers a seamless ‘Web 2.5’ user experience, enabling institutional access to tens of millions of carbon credits, and to KlimaDAO’s digital carbon infrastructure, without additional fees.",

KogeCoin avoided this problem and built up a strong community of dedicated HODLers.\r\n\r\nIf you missed out on our genesis airdrop, don’t fret! About 90% of the tokens allocated for the airdrop were unclaimed and will be distributed to holders of KogeCoin via staking at KogeFarm.io/farms, with rewards starting after June 10.

Holders of KogeCoin will benefit from the fees generated at KogeFarm.io, an auto-compounding utility we built for defi users.

      "description": "What Is Kyber Network (KNC)?\r\nKyber Network is a hub of liquidity protocols that aggregates liquidity from various sources to provide secure and instant transactions on any decentralized application (DApp). The main goal of Kyber Network is to enable DeFi DApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other users easy access to liquidity pools that provide the best rates.\r\n\r\nAll transactions on Kyber are on-chain, which means they can be easily verified using any Ethereum block explorer. Projects can build on top of Kyber to utilize all the services offered by the protocol, such as the instant settlement of tokens, liquidity aggregation, and a customizable business model.\r\n\r\nKyber looks to solve the liquidity issue in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry by allowing developers to build products and services without having to worry about liquidity for different needs. \r\n\r\nThe Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token is a utility token that is the \"glue that connects different stakeholders in Kyber's ecosystem.\" KNC holders can stake their tokens in the KyberDAO to help govern the platform and vote on important proposals — and earn staking rewards in Ethereum (ETH) that come from trading fees. \r\n\r\nWhat Makes Kyber Network Unique?\r\nKyber Network is the first tool that allows anyone to instantly swap tokens without the need of a third-party, like a centralized exchange. The unique architecture of Kyber is designed to be developer-friendly, which enables the protocol to be easily integrated with apps and other blockchain-based protocols.\r\n\r\nDeFi has many use cases and possibilities. Therefore, no single liquidity protocol can fit the needs of all liquidity providers, takers, and other market participants. Kyber’s liquidity hub architecture allows developers and the Kyber team to rapidly innovate and integrate new protocols into the overall Kyber Network to cater to different liquidity needs.\r\n\r\nIn April 2021, Kyber launched the Kyber DMM, the world’s first dynamic market maker protocol (DMM). Kyber DMM is a next-generation AMM designed to react to market conditions to optimise fees, maximise earnings, and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers, especially for stable pairs with low variability in price range (like USDC/USDT, ETH/SETH). They will be able to support pools with extremely high amplification factors, which means given the same liquidity pool and trade size, slippage can be 100x (or more) better than typical AMMs. Depending on their amplification strategy, liquidity providers can maximise the use of their capital and have the opportunity to earn much more fees relative to their contribution size, while takers can enjoy extremely low slippage on their trades.\r\n\r\nKyber DMM is the first of many new liquidity protocols that will be launched on the Kyber 3.0 Liquidity Hub.\r\n\r\nIn the Kyber ecosystem, KNC token holders play an important role in deciding new growth and value-capture opportunities and incentive mechanisms. Through KyberDAO, KNC holders can participate in the governance of the network by voting on important proposals. Kyber’s community is sizable and made up of a wide range of developers, in addition to other members of the blossoming DeFi industry.\r\n\r\nKyber’s fully on-chain design enables the protocol to maintain full transparency and verifiability. The platform claims to be the most used liquidity hub in the world.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Kyber Network Secured?\r\nAs an ERC-20 token, Kyber is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, Kyber uses an extensive trust and security model that protects users from misbehaving administrators or exchanges, thanks to security measures built in both at the protocol and smart contract level.\r\n\r\nThe platform has been audited by several third-party security firms and researchers, including Chainsecurity, which have determined that the protocol is secure and hence free of vulnerabilities.",

Featuring asset-based stablecoin vaults, a utility token, house flipping pools and a governance protocol, Landshare offers a full fledged DeFi platform based on US real estate assets. Simply stake your stablecoins in our Property Vault to earn yields based on the rental value and appreciation of assets, or invest in our house flipping pools to earn a lump sum payout. \r\n\r\nThe utility token of the platform is the Landshare Token. The token is earned as a reward for staking in the Property Vault and is required to access all platform features. The token features several price-stability elements, such as limited minting, buybacks, presale vesting, token burns, and supply cap. Additional utilities of the token include governance voting, staking, and charitable fundraising.\r\n\r\nThe flagship feature of the Landshare platform is the Property Vault. The Property Vault is a BUSD-based vault whose capacity is tied to the market value of Landshare’s referenced real estate assets. Investing in the vault entitles investors to stablecoin yields based on regional rental rates and property value appreciation of the referenced assets. In addition to stablecoin payouts, stakers also receive Landshare tokens and a bonus generated from yield farms for a combined average APR of 20-40%.",

Issued by Token Teknoloji Anonim Şirketi, this token is fully backed by Turkish lira on the blockchain at a 1:1 ratio and indexed to the price of Turkish lira. For every TRYT created, an equivalent amount of Turkish lira is held as collateral in the company's reserves.\r\n\r\nTRYT provides a cost-effective, fast and secure solution for global users, offering direct ownership with no storage costs and high accessibility for 24/7 transactions and transfers, regardless of geographical boundaries. Unlike fiat Turkish lira transaction limits in the market, there are no minimum transaction limits for TRYT.\r\n\r\nTRYT transactions are executed instantly and any amount of TRYT tokens can be converted to fiat currencies, ensuring quick and efficient transactions.\r\n\r\nTRYT is created and runs on the Avalanche C-Chain and Polygon blockchain, and it is compatible with all blockchain wallets that support EVM. It uses smart contracts to automatically manage the collateralization process.\r\n\r\nAs the demand for TRYT tokens increases, Token Teknoloji Anonim Şirketi will add the equivalent amount of Turkish lira to its reserves for each TRYT token upon request from institutions wishing to meet their demand. This ensures that the 1:1 ratio between Turkish lira and TRYT is maintained whilst keeping the market in balance between supply and demand.\r\n\r\nAnd a coin burn function is built into the blockchain's smart contract to remove a pre-determined amount of TRYT tokens from circulation when needed, ensuring a balance between TRYT and the Turkish lira. Thanks to this mint-and-burn mechanism, the price of TRYT is always in equilibrium with the price of the  Turkish lira.",

      "description": "MKR is a cryptocurrency depicted as a smart contract platform and works alongside the Dai coin and aims to act as a hedge currency that provides traders with a stable alternative to the majority of coins currently available on the market. Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker’s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward – it’s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It’s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker’s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It’s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don’t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.",

      "description": "Bad Days is a blockchain-based interactive trading and battling game.\r\n\r\nInspired by Stan Lee’s own hilarious cartoon series on YouTube called Bad Days which can be found on the channel Marvelous TV: https://www.youtube.com/c/MarvelousTV/videos, Bad Days allows players to Collect, Fuse, Battle, and Trade token-based Superheroes.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Days Alpha release includes 12 superheroes, and new characters are available each season.\r\n\r\nBad Days Characters come in 5 different rarity scales: common, uncommon, rare, legendary, and Mythic - and 5 attribute Levels measured by and known as the power grid, Each Bad Days Character is a custom ERC-1155 non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into PVP, PVE, and 3v3 battles, with each win earning Battle Points (BP), MNFT Shards, and game Items that are used to Unlock superpowers and build player attributes. These characters can be fused together to produce unique player-built battle decks, which can be used in the battle arenas.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Days ecosystem also has its own unique process, known as Fusion. There are two types of Fusion. First is the process of transferring superpowers from one character to another, permanently locking to the character creating a customised and unique NFT character asset. Second is the process of leveling up rarity and power grid attributes. The second process requires a Bad Days Character (BDC) to be burnt, thus reducing the (BDC) supply.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Marvelous NFTs (Bad Days)?\r\n\r\nBad Days was created in 2020 by Marvelous NFTs — a technology and art-focused game studio co-founded by Damian Rolvink and David Palmer.\r\n\r\nDamian Rolvink is the current CEO of the platform. Damian has accumulated over 20 years of experience in engineering and project management, specialising in government-funded projects. Being a gaming enthusiast and an early adopter of blockchain starting back in 2014, Damian found himself particularly interested in blockchain gaming and the NFT space, inspiring him to create this project.\r\n\r\nDavid Palmer is the current COO and Co-Founder of Marvelous NFTs. David has 25 years of experience as a supervisor and manager of teams, holding the position of Lead Supervisor for a construction company. David was first introduced to the space with day trading crypto and soon enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the industry full time. In 2018, David started producing promotional and marketing videos for a diverse range of blockchain projects and companies, establishing an extensive network of project leaders and team contacts. Being particularly enthused about NFT gaming projects, exploit testing, and assisting Alpha and Beta processes, along with being an avid collector of Marvel comics and memorabilia for many years, accumulating over 20,000 NFTs himself, co-founding Marvelous NFTs was a natural evolution for him.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Bad Days Unique?\r\n\r\nEach Bad Days character (BDC) possesses upgradable attribute power grids, and each character has its own set of superpower battle moves; the fusion process allows owners to customise their Bad Days Characters (BDC) superpowers producing a variety of strategic battle options and unique builds among Bad Days Characters (BDC), with the frequent addition of new character sets and Battle Cards (BC) an owner can fuse new additional Battle Cards (BC) and create powerful characters. Characters are classed into 6 elements, including - Cosmic, Gravity, Invulnerability, Teleportation, Lifeforce, and Telekinesis, each providing environment and battle advantages.\r\n\r\nMNFT token holders will soon be able to stake their LP tokens to receive regular rewards.\r\n\r\nHow Many Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nMarvelous NFTs (MNFT) tokens have a total supply of 275 million tokens. Out of this, 10,312,500 million tokens are in circulation at TGE.\r\n\r\nIn total, 3.75 % of the total supply was allocated to participants on the Public launchpad IDO sale (each MNFT token price at Listing price is $0.12), 6.25% was sold in seed, and strategic rounds and 5.75% was sold in a private sale. In addition to this, 5% is allocated for staking rewards, 20% to the play-to-earn pool, 15% to the team, 7% to advisors, 7.75% to the ecosystem fund, and 12.5% to operations and marketing. The remaining 11% is held in the escrow vault.\r\n\r\nHow Are the Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) Secured?\r\n\r\nThe Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) token is an ERC-20 token launched on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is secured by Ethereum’s proof-of-work (POW) consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) token is mapped to polygons Layer-2 protocol where all transactions and NFT minting is processed, with the benefits of reduced gas fees and fast transactions.\r\n\r\nThe Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) token includes a Bridge to Binance Smart Chain.\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Buy Marvelous NFTs (MNFT)?\r\n\r\nAs of January 2022, Marvelous NFTs (MNFT) will be available to trade on numerous exchange platforms, including DEX exchanges like PancakeSwap (BSC), Quickswap (Polygon), Uniswap (Ethereum)\r\n\r\nRelated Links:\r\n\r\nGame DAap- https://www.baddays.io Medium- https://marvelousnfts.medium.com Website- https://marvelousnfts.com Telegram- https://t.me/baddayscom Discord- https://discord.gg/ch89egzcTf Twitter- https://twitter.com/MarvelousNfts_",

      "description": "## What is MetaTrace? \r\n\r\nMetaTrace is the world's first GameFi project featuring a Free to Play and Earn model on a real-world map.\r\nThe MetaTrace application is a game incorporating a variety of game mechanics aimed at combining geolocation, blockchain environments, and classic game strategies.\r\nIt is based on augmented reality technology, which offers users a unique gaming experience and an easy immersion into the world of Web3 technologies. Project team is diligently working on creating a platform that will allow each player to realize their ideas and become the creator of their own adventures. The application is developed by professionals with experience working in top gaming studios: Niantic (Pokemon Go), Wargaming (World of Tanks), Kama Games, Game Insight, and others.\r\n\r\nThe virtual map of MetaTrace is a replica of the real world, reflecting our entire globe. Every step you take in the real world impacts the events occurring within the game. Your physical activity is reflected in the game space, and your avatar accurately replicates your movements. Explore the space and find rewards in Boxes. Each box contains ACE tokens, various NFTs for participating in mini-games. \r\n\r\n## What is MetaTrace's mission? \r\n\r\nProject's team primary mission is to inspire and motivate millions of people to have more contact with the real world and engage in physical activity every day. MetaTrace believes that they can introduce players to the world around them in a new way, help them broaden their horizons, meet people, and explore new locations. Collect digital artifacts within your city and interact with other players, forge friendships, and exchange resources in MetaTrace.\r\n\r\nMetaTrace is not inventing new \"utopian\" metaverses and virtual worlds; instead, project team enhances the real world with interactive elements using Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. This allows players to feel each challenge more intensely, meet with friends more often, and actively develop beyond the game.\r\n\r\nMetaTrace also set an ambitious goal for themselves:\r\nto introduce tens of millions of users to the world of Web3 technologies. \r\n\r\n## What are principles of MetaTrace? \r\n\r\n- Engaging and understandable gameplay is the primary focus of the project team.\r\n- Qualitative Free-to-play, freedom for players to choose their own game format, and the possibility to use NFTs for advanced users.\r\n- The stability of the game economy always takes precedence over scaling and profitability.\r\n- Transparency and attention to communication with players. It is important for us to be open with our community and improve the product based on user feedback. All information about the project, as well as the team, is publicly available.\r\n- Forming prize pools for players through a clear business model.\r\n- Simplicity and accessibility of Web3 solutions in the game, convenience for beginners.\r\n- The security of each user's personal data.\r\n- Active blocking of farming and combat against it in the game.\r\n\r\n## What are advantages of MetaTrace? \r\n\r\n</b>Decentralization</b>\r\n\r\nWe offer you a complete control over your gaming assets. Thanks to NFT technology, every item, character, or artifact you own in MetaTrace becomes unique and irreplaceable. You can be confident that no one can counterfeit, alter, or steal your assets. This gives you complete freedom to own, trade, and collect NFTs.\r\n\r\n<b>Communication</b>\r\n\r\nA unique experience of interacting with other players. You will be able to communicate, unite, compete, and collaborate with players from all over the world. Our platform provides safe and transparent transactions, allowing you to confidently interact with other players and trust them.\r\nYou can create teams, exchange assets, and jointly explore the virtual world.\r\n\r\n<b>Rewards</b>\r\n\r\nYou can earn cryptocurrency for gaming achievements. Your talent, skill, luck, experience, and game knowledge become the foundation for receiving rewards. You can sell your unique gaming assets or offer services to other players. We stimulate and encourage the community's contribution to creating a stable economic system.\r\n\r\n<b>Stability</b>\r\nWe are building a truly stable and fundamental economic system that has incorporated the most successful ways of monetization, reward distribution, onboarding, and other aspects. As you dive into our project and develop your profile, you can be confident in the project's longevity and robustness.\r\n\r\n<b>Technology scalability</b>\r\n\r\nExplore the real world at the intersection of technologies. Today, you use our map, a copy of the world, for orientation in the game, \"tomorrow\" it could be augmented reality glasses. Become the most experienced among the players and you will be amazed by the opportunities that will open up for you in the future. Our platform is constantly updated and evolves, offering the latest technological developments and content consumption during gaming adventures.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "MobiFi is building a web3 travel platform to connect digital nomads globally and create impact to the businesses locally. \r\n\r\nOur web3 travel platform is now innovatively bifurcated into two distinct yet synergistic components. Firstly, we offer a blockchain-based marketplace, a platform where users can list local services specifically tailored to cater to the needs of travelers. This approach not only enhances the travel experience but also nurtures local economies. Secondly, the platform empowers companies to provide web2 travel and mobility services (e.g., parking, hotel, car rental), leveraging our sophisticated web3 technology stack. This dual approach not only streamlines service offerings but also significantly enriches the user experience, positioning MobiFi at the forefront of the evolving travel industry. \r\n\r\nOur MobiFi app seamlessly integrates both pillars of our platform—blockchain-based marketplace and web2-based travel services—ensuring superior user experience and simplicity. Our team is diligently developing an innovative structure that facilitates the customization of mini-apps within our mobile application. This enhancement is designed to enable a broader range of service providers to join our platform in the future.\r\n\r\nThe blockchain-based marketplace operates under the governance of our community, utilizing our new governance token, which is scheduled for listing in 2024. This approach ensures fair and transparent operations, aligning perfectly with the values and expectations of our end users and community members.\r\n\r\nConcurrently, the web2-based travel and mobility services are managed directly by the service providers. This model ensures that our users receive the highest level of support, akin to traditional web2 companies, including reliable email and phone customer service. This hybrid approach not only leverages the strengths of both web3 and web2 paradigms but also guarantees a comprehensive and user-centric service experience.",

Monsoon uses zk-SNARKs to break the link between cross-chain and wallet-to-wallet transactions.\r\n\r\nMonsoon is building three privacy services: a wallet-to-wallet privacy tool, a multi-chain privacy bridge, and a multi-chain privacy DEX. The wallet-to-wallet privacy tool is a fork of Tornado Cash that supports multiple different EVM blockchains (including BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Moonbeam, Acala, etc) with a built-in protocol fee. \r\n\r\nThe multi-chain decentralized privacy bridge will allow users to move assets across any blockchain in a completely private and decentralized way. Monsoon nodes will stake MCASH to validate cross-chain transactions, but these transactions use zk-SNARKS to prevent nodes or any onlookers from linking deposits to withdrawals. A majority consensus amongst staking nodes must be achieved for transactions to be processed, meaning the process is both decentralized and private.",

During epoch expansions the protocol mints NACHO and distributes it proportionally to all NSHARE holders who have staked their tokens in the Bowl.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, NSHARE holders have voting rights (governance) on proposals to improve the protocol and future use cases within the NACHO money ecosystem.\r\n\r\nNACHO Bonds (NBOND) main job is to help incentivize changes in NACHO supply during an epoch contraction period.",

We call these cryptocurrencies NUM Stablecoins.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are several stablecoins on the cryptoasset market. However, most of them follow the price of currencies of developed countries. The most well-known examples are the stablecoins pegged to the US dollar as are USDT, USDC, DAI, etc. The existence of these currencies was fundamental to the development of the decentralized finance ecosystem that flourishes today on major blockchains. Activity in decentralized finance protocols grows linearly with the circulation of these stablecoins. In turn, there are other stablecoins that track the price of other currencies from developed countries, however, there are very few stablecoins from emerging or Latin American countries.\r\n\r\nNUM Finance seeks to facilitate access to cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance to millions of people and businesses in emerging countries through the creation and promotion of NUM Stablecoins. It is precisely in these countries, where monetary problems such as inflation, capital controls, lack of access to credit and complex financial products abound, that decentralized finance can have the greatest impact on the lives of citizens and the economic activity of companies. With NUM Stablecoins and the growth of their adoption, NUM Finance seeks to strengthen local currencies by adding a product that can be used by market players in a completely free manner.",

Over $20 billion of claims are trapped in the bankruptcy proceedings of FTX, Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, BlockFi, Hodlnaut, Mt Gox, 3AC, and other firms.\r\n\r\nOPNX solves this by being the first to provide tokenized claims trading on order books which can also be used as collateral to trade crypto futures. \r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nOPNX officially launched on April 3, 2023, as the world's first crypto and claims exchange.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 2023, OPNX launched its new token $OX, a new staking and governance platform called The Herd, and claims trading for Celsius. \r\n\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\nFollowing Celsius, we plan to offer FTX claims trading shortly in June. We aim to offer claims trading for as many bankruptcy estates available. The Herd is a staking / DAO type system for users to stake OX and is available at ox.opnx.com. We will be issuing various tokens into the \r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n$OX introduces a new exchange token model at the heart of the Open Ecosystem, comprising OPNX, The Herd (where users stake $OX and vote on governance), and a host of upcoming products. \r\n\r\n$OX disrupts the typical CEX token incentivization model by pioneering a staking fee discount model that is democratic, dynamically adjusting, and promotes alignment between the exchange and traders. Every user can receive up to a 100% fee discount in perpetuity by staking $OX tokens proportional to their share of trading activity. ",

      "description": "OUSG is a tokenized short-term US Treasury bills ETF, overseen and managed by Ondo Capital Management, a subsidiary of Ondo Finance. The significant majority of this portfolio is held in the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: SHV). There is also a small portion of USDC and USD for liquidity purposes.\r\nOUSG brings exposure to the ‘risk-free’ US Treasury rate on-chain for the first time. OUSG is an investment option that delivers a stable and predictable return while offering deep liquidity. Ondo funds such as OUSG only ever invest into ETFs backed by secure, stable, and liquid securities; these are the same assets in which trillions of dollars are invested every day by the world's largest institutions.\r\nOUSG was developed alongside two other fund tokens, OSTB and OHYG, by Ondo Finance, a software development firm in DeFi. Ondo launched in August 2021. Its first product was Ondo Vaults, a structured finance protocol on Ethereum. Later that year, Ondo launched Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS), facilitating over $210M in total liquidity provided.\r\n\r\nAs DeFi yields compressed in 2022, the Ondo team decided to sunset Vaults and LaaS (together, \"Ondo V1\") to focus on next-generation protocols. Ondo V2, including Ondo’s tokenized funds, were announced by Nathan Allman in January 2023. Ondo funds subsequently opened to subscriptions soon after. \r\n\r\nWhat can OUSG be Used For?\r\nFor investors who pass KYC and AML screening and sign subscription documents, OUSG tokens represent ownership in the fund. Investors can transfer these tokens between each other to effect changes in fund ownership. Investors can also use smart contracts to facilitate their financial arrangements such as by engaging in lending and trading activities with each other. \r\n\r\nThe tokens themselves have transfer restrictions that will ensure they do not end up in the hands of anyone not appropriately qualified as an investor in the fund.",

      "description": "What is Over the Reality (OVER)?\r\n\r\nOVER is an unparalleled Web3 Spatial Computing platform that merges the physical and virtual worlds through geo-localized Augmented Reality (AR). It's a visionary space where creators and brands converge to build the next evolution of the Internet—the Spatial Web. This transformation unlocks our existing web experience to create immersive, three-dimensional marvels that exist anywhere and at any time. The physical realm transforms into a digital canvas, enriched by limitless possibilities for play, social interaction, and commerce.\r\n\r\nOVER introduces a digital layer enveloping the physical world, comprising trillions of hexagon-shaped digital lands, known as OVRLands. These represent spatial domains, much like web domains control their webpages' content. In OVER, owning an OVRLand NFT grants control over the AR content displayed in 3D at specific geographic coordinates. OVRLand empowers users to forge unique geo-localized experiences that seamlessly bridge our physical and digital realities.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) movement, OVER's revolutionary Map2Earn™ program leverages the OVR token to incentivize community members to create detailed 3D maps of physical locations—OVRMaps—using just their smartphones. Participants can choose to mint their 3D data into an OVRMap NFT, retaining ownership, or sell it directly to OVER, thereby engaging in the Map2Earn incentive program. OVRMaps, serving as digital twins of the physical world, are vital for enabling spatial computation. They allow for remote, real-time exploration and precise indoor and outdoor re-localization, marking a significant leap from traditional to spatial computing.\r\n\r\nDedicated to cross-platform interoperability, OVER supports real-time augmented reality features, AI avatars, motion-captured interactions, and hyperrealistic NFT assets. With over 1.2 million registered users, 870,000+ OVRLands sold to more than 30,000 unique wallets.",

      "description": "Due to the immutable and transparent nature of public blockchains, DeFi users are subject to surveillance and economic espionage.\r\n\r\nDeFi traders risk losing their competitive advantages by having their transaction history observed and strategies reverse engineered and front-run, resulting in a material erosion of alpha and consequently a reduction in performance fees.\r\n\r\nWithout privacy, alpha and individual freedoms erode very quickly. Panther Protocol provides users with transactional privacy when interacting with DeFi, and protects their trading strategies and sovereignty. At the core of Panther's solution are zAssets--interoperable, fully collateralized privacy-enhancing digital assets--that leverage zkSNARK technology. Users are able to mint zero knowledge zAssets by depositing digital assets from any blockchain into Panther vaults and using these zAssets across a full range of DeFi applications.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to giving the users the ability to go fully private, there will be different levels of disclosures available. One of them, called Zero Knowledge disclosures, allows users to prove compliance without providing any underlying data, taking advantage of Zero Knowledge Proof technology and trust providers. This is a novel decentralized architecture for privacy and trust and lays the groundwork for institutional players to come into DeFi with a mitigated risk ready to be deployed.",

PIN is a new decentralized cryptocurrency, allowing website users and retail customers to earn crypto by posting content or interacting with certain websites or retail stores that utilize PIN’s unique payment, loyalty, or reward systems to reward their users in an exciting new way, and to allow for easy seamless transactional methods for users to buy subscriptions, website transactions, and in-store loyalty points. PIN gives website owners and retail stores this unique way to reward their users which will set them a level above their competitor's sites and stores, bringing in thousands of new users and customers who want to earn crypto instead of receiving the traditional rewards or points that only offer status or goods, instead of hard-earned crypto for their time. With PIN’s unique tokenomics which allow users to earn free tokens on partner websites and retail stores, a portion of the transaction fees is automatically redistributed to an owner’s pool to regenerate and supply PIN to website owners and retail stores at no cost. A portion of the transaction fees is also redistributed to reward our holders of PIN for their loyalty by way of automatic reflections.",

      "description": "The Peercoin network activated in 2012 and is one of the first cryptocurrencies to ever be released. It is responsible for inventing proof-of-stake consensus, which makes it the first efficient and sustainable public blockchain technology. Peercoin was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a>, and it shares much of the source code and technical implementation of bitcoin. The Peercoin source code is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license. Unlike bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/namecoin\">Namecoin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, Peercoin does not have a hard limit on the number of possible coins, but is designed to eventually attain an annual inflation rate of 1%. There is a deflationary aspect to Peercoin as the transaction fee of 0.01 PPC/kb paid to the network is destroyed. This feature, along with increased energy efficiency, aim to allow for greater long-term scalability.\r\n\r\nWith the same cryptographic hash function as Bitcoin (SHA-256), Peercoin is 100 times more energy efficient. Transactions in the Peercoin network are faster and cheaper. If there were not fierce competition on the cryptocurrency market, Peercoin would probably have long since become one of the most important cryptocurrencies. But in 2014 and 2015, however, there were many other interesting innovations in the cryptocurrency market that outperformed peercoin in a number of important properties. In contrast to DASH, Peercoin could not offer anonymity and the transactions in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a> were even faster and cheaper than those of Peercoin. PoS technology ceased to be an advantage of peercoin and PoS continued to spread to other cryptocurrencies. The interest of the users drew it to the side of the minings on the CPUs and GPUs, then to the side of the Smart Contracts and PPC began to get a little forgotten. \r\n\r\nThe Peercoin Team believes that adapting blockchains for wide scale use only through on-chain transactions will negatively affect the decentralization level and security of the network over time, therefore we choose to develop the Peercoin blockchain as a base layer settlement network with a sole focus on securing all forms of value recorded into the chain. This can be accomplished through Peercoin's philosophy of preserving and maximizing decentralization (which increases security) by developing the majority of features and technologies on top of the blockchain, rather than directly into the blockchain protocol itself.\r\n\r\nThus the Peercoin Team focuses on developing second layer protocols and sub-networks that can interact with the base layer blockchain to adapt it for wide scale use and improve functionality such as tokens, smart contracts and high speed low cost transaction processing. In this way, Peercoin will act as a secure and censorship resistant base layer for the future blockchain connected world.",

The project aims to offer an antidote to some of the most significant problems of Web 2.0 - surveillance capitalism, data exploitation and interruptive marketing - by enabling users to securely grant permission and monetize their data across the web, while providing an enterprise solution for marketers seeking better return on their ad spend.  \r\n\r\nGlobal privacy regulations, ad blockers, and dramatic changes in ad tech are forcing a new advertising model based on consent. By enabling marketers to build opt-in audiences and ask permission for engagement, and by ensuring users are rewarded for the data they volunteer to share, Permission sees ASK as foundational to helping tech platforms and marketers compete in Web 3.0. \r\n\r\nCurrently, users earn ASK by securely sharing their data and opting in to receive relevant ads and content. The experience is delivered primarily through declared data-sharing activities and engaging with video ads on Permission.io. Advertisers can also deploy ASK as an incentive mechanism on their own digital channels, driving loyalty and personalized ad campaigns. Additionally, the ability to earn and spend ASK via merchants on the Shopify platform is in the pipeline, with other major eCommerce platforms to follow. \r\n\r\nThe project’s other goals include deeper development of its proprietary technology, “Data Algebra,” for which it has been awarded 9 patents. The breakthrough technology can liquify data currently stored in silos and applications, making it possible for individuals to aggregate and monetize their full data set and for companies to gain permissioned visibility over the most comprehensive data sets possible. \r\n",

      "description": "The native cryptographically-secured fungible protocol token of Pine (ticker symbol $PINE) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Pine, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.\r\n\r\n$PINE functions as the native governance token, access token, and economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribution and participation in the ecosystem on Pine, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. $PINE is an integral and indispensable part of Pine, because without $PINE, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on Pine. Given that additional $PINE will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and efforts made on Pine and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of Pine and/or holders of $PINE which did not actively participate will not receive any $PINE incentives.\r\n\r\n$PINE Holders will have control over the PineDAO which governs both the Pine protocol and the Pine Platform and manages their future development. $PINE would allow holders to propose and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features and/or parameters of Pine, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of Pine; it does not entitle $PINE holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, nor does $PINE constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). For example, users may propose usage of the PineDAO Treasury (which holds protocol funds) for platform/protocol maintenance, enhancements, grants, strategic partnership budgets, governance initiatives and other incentive programs. After governance launch there will be no individual or corporate entity or other active promoter, sponsor, or group or affiliated party that maintains sole control over Pine.\r\n\r\nPine itself is simply a blockchain protocol that, by design, does not offer any resources for utilisation As such, in order for the protocol to perform its core function as a NFT liquidity protocol, users would need to be incentivised to deposit assets in the borrowing liquidity pools to provide liquidity for loans. As their reward, these liquidity providers which help to promote adoption of Pine by staking or including assets to liquidity pools in exchange for LP tokens would be rewarded with $PINE, according to each user's relative contribution after various adjustment and correction parameters. By distributing $PINE in this manner, it ensures that the governance token will be distributed primarily to key network contributors and allow them to have a say in protocol parameters.\r\n\r\nLikewise, users which deposit their NFTs and take out loans may also participate in the user incentive programs.\r\n\r\n$PINE functions as a loyalty membership point, so users will be classified into different loyalty tiers based on the amount of $PINE held, user activity, and/or volume of transactions. $PINE Holders will get exclusive access to tier-based special perks and access rights, some examples are exclusive first rights to buy certain liquidated NFT assets, interest rate or service fee discount for borrowing, or achieving seniority in the platform which will allow the lender to charge more favourable interest rates on loans.",

USDR has its own value accrual system built into its design, differentiating it from other currencies. Using a consistent stream of dependable yield derived from rental revenue, USDR will deliver a native real yield to stakers through a daily rebase.\r\n\r\nAs an asset class, real estate is inflation-proof and wealth generating, making it an ideal backing for a stablecoin. While the dollar has lost over 80% of its purchasing power over the past 50 years, the price of single-family home has gone up by 14x in countries like the United States. So a real estate backed stablecoin not only works as a hedge against the volatility of crypto markets, it also protects holders from the impacts of ongoing currency debasement.\r\n\r\nUSDR is minted using DAI and can always be redeemed 1:1 for DAI. Treasury DAI is used to purchase and tokenize income-generating real estate, which is added to the treasury and serves as the primary source of protocol yield. As the value of the tokenized real estate appreciates over time, USDR becomes overcollateralized.\r\n\r\nBringing RWAs on-chain allows for transparent, trust-minimized and efficient access to categories like the ~$330T global real estate market.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "RELAY is a multi cross-chain platform developed to bring BaaS (Bridging as a Service) to help the often fragmented DeFi liquidity space. What is really unique to our bridge is that when a new ecosystem is created, our bridge connects that asset and ecosystem to all the other ones we support. At launch we currently support bridging to Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polygon (Matic), and Heco — with more coming soon. Relay's bridges were first to introduce the bridge gas token faucet to Defi where the bridge itself airdrops the native gas token to new users to reduce friction for people starting out on new chains.\r\n\r\nOur goal at Relay Chain is simple, \"\"Have the best and safest bridge\"\". We will provide value to our token holders by giving them native gas tokens for providing liquidity instead of our native project token (RELAY). By doing this we eliminate all sell pressure to Relay and we can give the highest APY's to Relay Liquidity Providers. This allows us to have a token that provides value, and it's deflationary (via buyback and burns) which is doing with a portion of the gas token profits from bridge transactional volume. The brings the positive feedback loops and true ecosystem synergy into the Relay Chain ecosystem where all partners provide utility to the end users of our platform.",

      "description": "What Is Request (REQ)?\r\nThe Request (REQ) utility token, launched in 2017, ensures the performance and stability of the Request Network. The Request Network itself is an Ethereum-based decentralized payment system where anyone can request a payment and receive money through secure means. It removes the requirement for third parties in order to provide a cheaper, more secure payment solution that works with all global currencies.\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates a request for payment, they define to which address the payment needs to be allocated and what the amount is. The user can also define the terms and conditions of the payment, upgrading a simple request into an invoice. Once this is completed, the user can share their request to be paid by their counterparty.\r\n\r\nEvery step is documented and stored on the Request network, allowing everyone involved to easily keep track of all the invoices and payments for accounting purposes.\r\n\r\nRequest is also integrated with legislation across the world to remain compliant with the trade laws of each individual country.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Request?\r\nThe founders of Request are Christophe Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur.\r\n\r\nChristophe Lassuyt is currently the chief financial officer at Request. Before this position, he co-founded MONEYTIS.\r\n\r\nEtienne Tatur is the chief technical officer of Request. Prior to this, he also co-founded MONEYTIS and worked as a lead developer at QOBUZ, a music streaming service.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Request Unique?\r\nThe payments on Request are performed by simply sending an invoice through the blockchain; the counterparty can then detect the request and pay it with one click in a peer-to-peer manner. The fact that the payments are push-generated instead of pull-generated is one of Request’s key advantages. There is no need for users to share their account information. The use of blockchain technology also eliminates the need for third-party processors, resulting in a reduction in transaction costs.\r\n\r\nThe Request Network leverages decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum and IPFS for an increased level of security, privacy and data ownership for the end-user. The platform does have transaction fees, which is a cost that is required to broadcast a change to the blockchain network. The transaction fees are used to incentivize miners to reach consensus on the state of the network.\r\n\r\nREQ can be stored on wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger, imToken, Trezor, Atomic Wallet, Jaxx Liberty and Trust Wallet.\r\n\r\nHow Many Request (REQ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\nREQ is an ERC-20 token that can be spent to use the Request Network.\r\n\r\nA portion of the REQ fee is burned at a rate that is determined by the current supply and the exchange rate with other currencies.\r\n\r\nRequest’s (REQ) circulating supply is at 999,912,165 REQ as of February 2021 and the maximum supply is 999,983,984 tokens.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Request Network Secured?\r\nREQ is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum platform. The requests made with REQ are stored on an immutable digital ledger. This ledger also serves as proof for all auditing purposes.",

Similar to how central banks manage the money supply in,traditional finance, LST provides a decentralized approach to asset management and liquidity provision\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that this transformation is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in the financial paradigm, offering individuals worldwide the opportunity to shape their financial future, regardless of market fluctuations.\r\n\r\nRTK serves as the lifeblood of the RetaFi ecosystem, facilitating seamless transactions, incentivizing user engagement, and fostering liquidity across various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Users obtain RTK tokens through the process of restaking, wherein staked assets such as BNB, ETH, SOL, and others are converted into derivative tokens such as pBNB, fBNB, which can be restaked to yield RTK tokens. RTK tokens offer users unparalleled flexibility and utility within the RetaFi ecosystem, enabling participation in diverse DeFi activities such as yield farming, liquidity provision, and asset borrowing.\r\n\r\n***Key Features of RTK:\r\n\r\nEcosystem Utility: RTK tokens unlock access to a wide array of DeFi services and protocols within the RetaFi ecosystem.\r\n\r\nYield Generation: Users can earn RTK tokens through the process of restaking, compounding their rewards and maximizing their returns.\r\n\r\nInteroperability: RTK tokens can be seamlessly traded, exchanged, or utilized across various DeFi platforms and protocols, enhancing liquidity and interoperability.",

SelfKey is a self-sovereign identity system that is based on the blockchain and can provide control and management of digital identities to users. Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management systems. These include the lack of accessibility to financial services and the tedious KYC processes that are paper based.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of SelfKey is the self-hosted data storage. This lets you secure your identity documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems. The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY, and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey. \r\n\r\nOn his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose “skill sets lie at the crossroads of finance, technology, and law/regulations.” Additionally, he has been involved with other projects related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed ledgers. Terry Lin is the product manager for this venture. In the past, Terry has been associated with many established projects including, AMZ Tracker, UBS and Build My Online Store. Lastly, Ari Propis is the accounting backbone of SelfKey. He has been in the crypto domain for more than five years and has previously worked as a consultant for various blockchain and international accounting startups. It was introduced into the market earlier this year, KEY tokens were initially traded at a modest price of US$0.08 per token.",

Built on top of Avacus, a Web3 super-app, it seamlessly integrates messaging with Web3 wallets. Users can send cryptocurrencies and NFTs on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains to friends as easily as sending a message. Avacus envisions a world where this super-app becomes the central hub for all your needs, with Web3 advertising being the key to its success.\r\nAvacus goes beyond messaging by offering native community management features. This provides an alternative to popular platforms for group and community building within the Web3 space. These features will foster a variety of communities within the Avacus ecosystem, such as those between NFT creators and fans, musicians and followers, or groups with shared hobbies or goals. These communities themselves become platforms for advertising, allowing them to generate income through incentive-based advertising (ads with token rewards), thereby revitalizing the community itself.\r\nCurrently, external income options in Web3 are limited to DeFi transaction fees and NFT sales commissions. Avacus introduces a new channel for earning through Web3 advertising. The ecosystem empowers users to:\r\nEarn income by managing or participating in communities.\r\nSave Avacus-generated income for asset management in DeFi.\r\nMake purchases using Avacus.\r\nAvacus aspires to become a daily-used Web3 super-app, ultimately realizing its vision of a self-sustaining Avacus ecosystem fueled by Web3 advertising.",

The only way to mine STARS is to deposit your MATIC on our website and receive SRX tokens as a reward.\r\n2. Number of accrued tokens.SRX tokens are credited to your account in real-time. The number of tokens awarded for each MATIC deposited fixed for each level.For example, at LEVEL 1, you will be credited with 0.16 SRX per day for each MATIC deposited. That is if you have a deposit of 100 MATIC means at the 1st level you will receive 16 STARS tokens per day.\r\n3. Chronology of SRX mining. STARS mining will officially start on June, 2023, and will end when all 27,000,000 SRX will be mined.\r\n4. Fairness of mining.

The changes in the relative prices are predictable, and so the opportunity to profit doesn't depend on speculation.

Behind every NFT creator is a community that establishes the value of creator's social capital.\r\n\r\nIn traditional Web 2 social media platforms, the number of ‘Likes’ or ‘Followers’ is directly correlated to their earnings power.

Instead of ‘following‘ a creator, participants can stake with their creator pool. Value is established based on the pool participation TVL.

      "description": "What is tBTC?\r\ntBTC allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much more.\r\n\r\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by main-net BTC. Existing solutions bringing Bitcoin to Ethereum require you to send your Bitcoin to an intermediary, who then issues you an Ethereum token representing your original asset. \r\n\r\nThis centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is prone to censorship, sacrificing Bitcoin's promise of secure, permissionless decentralization.\r\n\r\nHow does tBTC solve this issue?\r\nInstead of centralized intermediaries, tBTC uses a randomly selected group of operators running nodes on the Threshold Network to secure deposited Bitcoin through threshold cryptography. \r\n\r\nThat means tBTC requires a threshold majority agreement before operators perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection of operators weekly, tBTC protects against any individual or group of operators colluding to fraudulently seize the underlying deposits. \r\n\r\nBy relying on an honest-majority-assumption, we can calculate the likelihood any wallet comprised of a quorum of dishonest operators. An insurance backstop (the coverage pools), serves as an emergency fallback in the event a wallet is compromised.\r\n\r\nWhat is Threshold Network?\r\nThreshold.network stems from the merger of NuCypher and Keep networks into a single decentralized network — it delivers a suite of threshold cryptography services for web3 applications through a decentralized network of staking nodes. The whole community is governed by a DAO.\r\n\r\nFlagship services of Threshold Network include Threshold Access Control (TACo) – which enables end-to-end encrypted data sharing and communication without the need to trust a centralized authority, tBTC v2 - the only decentralized and permissionless Bitcoin-to-Ethereum asset bridge and thUSD - an overcollateralized and decentralized USD stablecoin that uses both ETH and tBTC as collateral.",

Inputs to a data series are secured by a network of staked miners. The main Tellor smart contract creates a time series of each requested data series and aims to become the standard source of high value data for decentralized applications.

We're not a standard \"copy and paste yield farm\" - we're here to create a #FarmRevolution!\r\n\r\nRevolution #1: Buyback-and-Make circular tokenomics\r\n\r\nTimeleap is a yield farm with a max supply yet no additional layers. Normally, a max supply would mean that token emissions and farming would end. \r\n\r\nWhat we've done to make farming continue even after all tokens are minted is to create an automated way to refill/top up the Masterchef (MC) contract - by buying back TIME from the market and depositing it in MC. Farming emissions continue normally as if we never reached max supply to begin with! \r\n\r\nRevolution #2: Wormholes product\r\n\r\nWe function as a \"fund manager\" to recommend you other projects to invest in, based on your risk level / what returns you’re expecting. We conduct independent reviews for each project before deciding to add it to our Wormholes product. You invest in one currency (stable coin or large cap), and you earn the auto-compounded returns in that same currency. \r\n\r\nOn our roadmap are more #FarmRevolutions. This includes an innovation on the typical dividend pools that most farms have, as well as a DeFi NFT game - both of which are currently in progress.\r\n\r\nFinally, we're highly secure: DxLocked Liquidity, Timelocked, Ownership renounced, and two Paladin audits completed. Timeleap Finance is also an official JetSwap and WaultSwap partner.\r\n",

Unlike traditional social media platforms, TOKHIT is completely ad-free and rewards users for their time and content contributions. The app features two content feeds where users can post content, two play-to-earn games, and the option to promote NFTs minted on other platforms.\r\n\r\nThe project’s cryptocurrency, the HITT token, will be used to reward content creators, provide revenue streams, and fund the project. The token will have multiple utilities in the future, including NFT trading and providing access to various digital assets and collectibles, subscription programs, membership programs, AirHugs, staking rewards, governance rights, in-app payments, in-app rewards, and monetization opportunities.\r\n\r\nTOKHIT aims to create a robust ecosystem of interconnected digital products that share a common token-based economy. The project was launched in Q3 2021, and the HITT token was introduced at the same time. The project has a roadmap that included launching the App Store and reaching $100 million in capitalization in Q2 2022. Future plans include building the Android and Web versions of the app.\r\n What makes TOKHIT unique is its blend of decentralized social media with the perks of Blockchain and NFT technology. This provides more creative freedom to users and allows them to earn instant rewards through their content contributions. TOKHIT’s ultimate goal is to enhance a user’s experience in the app and strengthen the utility of their tokens.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the HITT tokens can be used to join the VIP staking program available exclusively in the Welthee App. The team is also working on listing the token on the exchanges, with a timeline to be discussed. Additionally, the team is working on launching their staking program, which is currently under certification.",

TruMATIC is the liquid staking token users receive when they deposit MATIC into the TruStake vault. It is an ERC-20 token like MATIC and has all the same basic functionality. As soon as a user deposits MATIC on the TruStake smart contract, they receive newly minted TruMATIC, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. As MATIC staking rewards accrue, the value of TruMATIC increases (with reference to MATIC).\r\n\r\n- Users have have the ability to stake their MATIC through TruFin’s [dApp](https://app.trufin.io/).\r\n- When a user stakes with TruFin, they will mint a new liquid token — TruMATIC.\r\n- Rewards are restaked automatically, giving an uplift in APY from the compounding effect.\r\n\r\nThe TruMATIC liquid token is self-custodied, meaning holders have complete control over their TruMATIC at all times, with a broad set of possibilities:\r\n\r\n- **Target ~5%+ APY:** TruMATIC will deliver optimised staking rewards on the staked MATIC. Auto-restaking means your APY rides on the power of compounding.\r\n- **DeFi Interoperability:** TruMATIC’s token design ensures seamless integration with a myriad of DeFi protocols — from DEXs to lending/borrowing protocols to yield optimizers.\r\n- **Liquidity Pools:** Get ready for MATIC<>TruMATIC liquidity pools on leading DEXs, enabling a smooth liquidity provision for users seeking to exit their TruMATIC positions.",

      "description": "About VERSE\r\nBitcoin.com's rewards and utility token VERSE accelerates global adoption of cryptocurrency in the self-custodial model through incentives and gamification. Since 2015, Bitcoin.com has been a global leader in introducing newcomers to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. With over 50 million self-custody wallets created (as of Jun 2024) in its multichain DeFi-ready mobile app (the Bitcoin.com Wallet app), an award-winning news portal with over 2.5 million monthly readers, a wide range of educational resources, and 24-hour human support, Bitcoin.com is the world’s gateway to Bitcoin and beyond. By incentivizing and gamifying engagement in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem, VERSE supercharges Bitcoin.com’s mission to onboard the world to decentralized money and increase economic freedom. \r\n\r\nWhat makes VERSE different?\r\nVERSE is seamlessly integrated in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem and readily accessible to millions of users. Bitcoin.com attracts and retains millions of newcomers to crypto every year via its powerful brand, domain, and products. The ecosystem guides newcomers on their own individual journeys, enabling them to benefit from the rapidly expanding range of applications in crypto. \r\n\r\nWhat is the utility of VERSE token?\r\nVERSE can be earned by using products in Bitcoin.com’s ecosystem, held for discounts and perks, and used in apps and dApps. In late 2023, fxVERSE was deployed on Polygon, paving the way for a micro-rewards system. \r\n\r\nWhat are the key components of the Bitcoin.com VERSE ecosystem? \r\nAt the heart of the ecosystem is the multichain Bitcoin.com Wallet app. Within the app, users can find a web3-enabled browser called Verse Explorer that allows for convenient interaction with a variety of dApps and web3 features. These include the multichain decentralized exchange Verse DEX, the Verse Voyager NFT collection and minting dApp, and a range of engaging dApps that are designed to educate users on how to safely interact with web3 products.\r\n\r\nHow does the buy back and burn mechanism work? \r\nBitcoin.com buys VERSE on the open market through Bitcoin.com’s decentralized exchange Verse DEX, third-party DEXs, centralized exchanges, or in Over-The-Counter trades. This VERSE is then sent to the Verse Burn Engine, where it accumulates until a burn is triggered (anyone can trigger a burn). \r\n\r\nWhat is the sustainable supple reduction mechanism?\r\nVERSE is allocated from the Ecosystem Fund to the Verse Burn Engine in a manner that is proportional to a given activity in the Verse/Bitcoin.com ecosystem, as well as in a manner that ensures that the reduction of supply is sustainable over the lifetime of the token.\r\n",

The ViciCoin token was created by ViciNFT to strictly manage access to digital content and enable a wide range of enterprise applications through authorization, authentication, and intermediary services. For example, VCNT now facilitates ViciSwap, a many-to-many token swapping tool built on the Uniswap Protocol. ViciSwap offers a dynamic and engaging solution for everyone to create and manage their own token portfolio (https://viciswap.io). Another application of ViciCoin in the enterprise is VCNT For Zoom, which provides a turnkey solution for small communities across the globe to monetize their own video conferences by selling tokenized tickets and accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. VCNT is also being used to gate access to Discord channels, which helps creators and brand owners authenticate their community to reduce bots and spam, and increase monetization of their offerings. As Web3 products and services become mainstream, so will the utility and serviceability of VCNT.",

      "description": "VirtuSwap goal is to make DEX trading as efficient as CEX trading.\r\nVirtuSwap innovation is centered on two main aspects. Firstly, the VirtuSwap AMM based DEX implement a new backend architecture that uses “Virtual Reserves”, which enable to significantly increase liquidity efficiency while solving the problem of indirect trades that 99% of crypto-assets suffers from. VirtuSwap DEX achieves that by enabling Liquidity Pools to hold, for a limited scope, making all pools work as an orchestra to direct liquidity to the trade, thus eliminating the need for costly indirect trade when trading assets with insufficient direct liquidity.\r\nSecondly, VirtuSwap developed the “Minerva Engine”, an AI-based optimizer that analyzes real trading activity to suggest the optimal allocation of economic incentives to Liquidity Providers, thus making VRSW emission allocation derive from informed real data basis.\r\nIn the future VirtuSwap will also incorporate a hedging model that will enable small to medium cap project who suffers the most from insufficient direct liquidity, to support trading with multiple assets by opening a single pool.\r\nVRSW token is VirtuSwap governance token, and can be used for Staking or Locking to receive increased economic incentives, as well as voting on the governance of the protocol using vote-escrowed VRSW, noted as gVRSW.\r\n",

The wLiti DAO’s governance smart contract will not be able to execute any transactions unless the wLiti DAO members approve the transaction through the use of proposals and voting.

The token operates on a 1:1 ratio with Kaspa, meaning each Wrapped Kaspa token is equivalent to one Kaspa. This approach enables the transfer of value between the two separate blockchains, bridging the gap and allowing users to utilize the benefits of both networks.\r\n\r\nThe key benefit of wKAS is the ability for users to participate in Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem using their Kaspa holdings, unlocking access to a wide range of services including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, yield farming, and more.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the balance of wKAS and KAS, Chainge, a trusted custodian, holds the necessary amount of KAS in reserve. This ensures the value of the wrapped token and allows for the reverse process (unwrapping), where users can exchange their wKAS back into KAS at any time.",

One's tPOKT balance continously increases due to distributions of node rewards via rebase. This causes one's tPOKT balance to continously increase. Unfortunately, some DeFi protocols, like Uniswap v3, keep track of user's balances, which causes users to lose rebase rewards. These types of protocols require fixed-balance tokens for optimal usage.\r\nTo achieve this, we created a fixed balance token for tPOKT let's you \"\"wrap\"\" your tPOKT into wtPOKT to keeps your token balance fixed. wtPOKT and tPOKT are interchangeable at any time, and earn the exact same rewards. The only difference is that one's wtPOKT balance will stay the same, but will be redeemable for more tPOKT, whereas one's tPOKT balance will just increase.",

      "description": "wUSDR is a wrapped version of USDR. \r\n\r\nUSDR is the world’s first stablecoin collateralized by tokenized, yield-producing real estate. USDR has its own value accrual system built into its design, differentiating it from other currencies. Using a consistent stream of dependable yield derived from rental revenue, USDR will deliver a native real yield to stakers through a daily rebase, projected to range between 10 - 20% APY. As an asset class, real estate is inflation-proof and wealth generating, making it an ideal backing for a stablecoin. While the dollar has lost over 80% of its purchasing power over the past 50 years, the price of single-family home has gone up by 14x in countries like the United States. So a real estate backed stablecoin not only works as a hedge against the volatility of crypto markets, it also protects holders from the impacts of ongoing currency debasement. USDR is minted using DAI and can always be redeemed 1:1 for DAI. Treasury DAI is used to purchase and tokenize income-generating real estate, which is added to the treasury and serves as the primary source of protocol yield. As the value of the tokenized real estate appreciates over time, USDR becomes overcollateralized.\r\n\r\nTokenized real world assets are the path to meaningfully grow the market cap of crypto and DeFi, reaching the next billion users in the process. Bringing RWAs on-chain allows for transparent, trust-minimized and efficient access to categories like the ~$330T global real estate market. Without the need for a mortgage or a downpayment, it’s now possible for anyone with a phone to access many of the benefits of real estate though USDR.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.\r\n\r\nIt started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. \r\n\r\nThe service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. \r\n\r\nLater on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. \r\n\r\nYearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. \r\n\r\nVaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
